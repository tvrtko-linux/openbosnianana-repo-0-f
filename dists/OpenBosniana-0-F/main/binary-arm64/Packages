Description: close gaps in genomic alignments from short reads
 ABACAS (Algorithm Based Automatic Contiguation of Assembled Sequences)
 intends to rapidly contiguate (align, order, orientate), visualize and
 design primers to close gaps on shotgun assembled contigs based on a
 reference sequence.
 .
 ABACAS uses MUMmer to find alignment positions and identify syntenies
 of assembled contigs against the reference. The output is then processed
 to generate a pseudomolecule taking overlapping contigs and gaps in to
 account. ABACAS generates a comparison file that can be used to
 visualize ordered and oriented contigs in ACT. Synteny is represented by
 red bars where colour intensity decreases with lower values of percent
 identity between comparable blocks. Information on contigs such as the
 orientation, percent identity, coverage and overlap with other contigs
 can also be visualized by loading the outputted feature file on ACT.

Description: package for electronic structure calculations (Data files)
 ABINIT is a package whose main program allows one to find the total energy,
 charge density and electronic structure of systems made of electrons and
 nuclei (molecules and periodic solids) within Density Functional Theory (DFT),
 using pseudopotentials and a planewave basis.
 .
 ABINIT also includes options to optimize the geometry according to the DFT
 forces and stresses, or to perform molecular dynamics simulations using these
 forces, or to generate dynamical matrices, Born effective charges, and
 dielectric tensors. Excited states can be computed within the Time-Dependent
 Density Functional Theory (for molecules), or within Many-Body Perturbation
 Theory (the GW approximation). In addition to the main ABINIT code, different
 utility programs are provided.
 .
 This package contains a set of pseudopotentials and example inputs.

Description: package for electronic structure calculations (Documentation)
 ABINIT is a package whose main program allows one to find the total energy,
 charge density and electronic structure of systems made of electrons and
 nuclei (molecules and periodic solids) within Density Functional Theory (DFT),
 using pseudopotentials and a planewave basis.
 .
 ABINIT also includes options to optimize the geometry according to the DFT
 forces and stresses, or to perform molecular dynamics simulations using these
 forces, or to generate dynamical matrices, Born effective charges, and
 dielectric tensors. Excited states can be computed within the Time-Dependent
 Density Functional Theory (for molecules), or within Many-Body Perturbation
 Theory (the GW approximation). In addition to the main ABINIT code, different
 utility programs are provided.
 .
 This package contains the documentation and tutorials.

Description: synchronizes musical applications on multiple devices - development
 Ableton Link, a technology that synchronizes musical beat, tempo, and phase
 across multiple applications running on one or more devices. Applications on
 devices connected to a local network discover each other automatically and form
 a musical session in which each participant can perform independently: anyone
 can start or stop while still staying in time. Anyone can change the tempo, the
 others will follow. Anyone can join or leave without disrupting the session.
 .
 Ableton Link is implemented as a header-only C++-library.
 This package contains the development files.

Description: The Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide
 An in-depth exploration of the art of shell scripting.
 .
 This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or
 programming, but progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced
 level of instruction ... all the while sneaking in little snippets
 of UNIX(R) wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for
 self-study, and a reference and source of knowledge on shell
 scripting techniques. The exercises and heavily-commented examples
 invite active reader participation, under the premise that the only
 way to really learn scripting is to write scripts.
 .
 This book is suitable for classroom use as a general introduction to
 programming concepts.

Description: autoconf like tool
 ACR is an autoconf like tool that allows you to create configure scripts for
 your programs. The main aim of this tool is to teach developers how to create
 portable builds of their tools, just using generic functions wrapped by acr to
 generate portable shellscript.
 .
 Pros:
   * Easy to learn / implement.
   * Faster/smaller final configure script.
   * Own syntax, not complex m4 macros.
   * Reverse engineering tool to recover .acr files from the final configure
     script.
   * Good documentation and tutorials.
   * vim syntax highlighting for configure.acr files
     ($PREFIX/share/acr/vim/install.sh)
   * Debugging support (-d)
   * Integrated support for java, bash, perl, Tcl, c, c++, ruby and Python.
   * Recursive configure script calls.
   * Progress bar in generation stage.
 .
 Cons:
   * Not recommended for huge projects
   * Slow script generation parsing huge configuration files
   * No automake replace. (just type clean makefiles and acr substs)
   * Not enough tested (only on free operating systems (Open|Net|Free|Dfly)BSD,
     GNU systems, and Darwin).

 This program searches for and removes remnant adapter sequences from High-
 Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data and (optionally) trims low quality
 bases from the 3' end of reads following adapter removal. AdapterRemoval
 can analyze both single end and paired end data, and can be used to
 merge overlapping paired-ended reads into (longer) consensus sequences.
 Additionally, the AdapterRemoval may be used to recover a consensus
 adapter sequence for paired-ended data, for which this information is
 not available.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 'Adduser' will choose UID and GID values that conform to Debian policy,
 create a home directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and
 automate setting initial values for the user's password, real name
 and so on.
 .
 'Deluser' can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.
 .
 'Adduser' and 'Deluser' are intended to be used by the local
 administrator in lieu of the tools from the 'useradd' suite, and
 they provide support for easy use from Debian package maintainer
 scripts, functioning as kind of a policy layer to make those scripts
 easier and more stable to write and maintain.

Description: aegisub language packages
 Originally created as tool to make typesetting, particularly in anime
 fansubs, a less painful experience, Aegisub has grown into a fully
 fledged, highly customizable subtitle editor.
 .
 It features a lot of convenient tools to help you with timing, typesetting,
 editing and translating subtitles, as well as a powerful scripting environment
 called Automation (originally mostly intended for creating karaoke effects,
 Automation can now be used much else, including creating macros and various
 other convenient tools).
 .
 This package contains language packages for the following languages:
 ca, cs, da, de, el, es, fa, fi, fr, hu, id, it, ja, ko, pl, pt_BR, pt_PT, ru,
 sr_RS, vi, zh_CN, zh_TW

Description: text-based authoring tool for HTML
 Aephea is an HTML authoring framework.  It enforces HTML well-formedness
 with a simpler and stricter syntax, provides useful extensions and
 abstractions as well as facilities for adding new ones, all in a single
 unified approach that stays close to HTML itself.  Some of Aephea's
 characteristics are a TeX-like syntax, dictionary stacks, iteration and a
 focus on styling via CSS.
 .
 PUD (Portable Unix Documentation) is shipped with Aephea.  It provides
 mini-languages for authoring Unix manual pages and FAQ documents with output
 both in HTML and troff.
 .
 Both Aephea and PUD are written in zoem, a high-level macro/programming
 language with character filtering capabilities.
 .
 If you'd like to generate manpages, but don't like troff syntax, and find
 Perl's POD too limited, Aephea's PUD is likely useful for you. If you like
 your documents to be available in both PDF and HTML, but find DocBook XML
 too heavyweight (and aren't really happy with Docbook XML's baroque default
 tagnames), you'll like PUD.

Description: Tagging script for notmuch mail
 The basic task of afew is to provide automatic tagging each time new
 mail is registered with notmuch. In a classic setup, you might call it
 after 'notmuch new' in an offlineimap post sync hook.
 .
 In addition to more elementary features such as adding tags based on
 email headers or maildir folders, handling killed threads and spam, it
 can do some heavy magic in order to /learn/ how to initially tag your
 mails based on their content.
 .
 In move mode, afew will move mails between maildir folders according to
 configurable rules that can contain arbitrary notmuch queries to match
 against any searchable attributes.

Description: "free form" document preparation system
 AFT is a document preparation system. It is mostly free form meaning that there

 ASCII text.
 .
 AFT has a few rules for structuring your document and these rules have more to
 do with formatting your text rather than embedding commands.
 .
 Right now, AFT produces pretty good (weblint-able) HTML, XHTML, LaTeX, lout and
 RTF. It can, in fact, be coerced into producing all types of output (e.g.
 roll-your-own XML). All that needs to be done is to edit a rule file. You can
 even customize your own HTML rule files for specialized output.

 (Private Use Area), and is meant to specify preferred glyph names for
 new fonts. Also included is the ITC Zapf Dingbats Glyph List, which is
 similar to AGL in that it maps glyph names to Unicode values for the
 purpose of deriving content, but only for the glyphs in the ITC Zapf
 Dingbats font.

Description: Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment - Common files
 AIDE is an intrusion detection system that detects changes to files on
 the local system. It creates a database from the regular expression rules
 that it finds from the config file. Once this database is initialized
 it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several
 message digest algorithms (md5, sha1, rmd160, tiger, haval, etc.) that are
 used to check the integrity of the file. More algorithms can be added
 with relative ease. All of the usual file attributes can also be checked
 for inconsistencies.
 .
 This package contains base and configuration files that are needed to
 run the actual binaries.
 .
 You will almost certainly want to tweak the configuration file in
 /etc/aide/aide.conf or drop your own config snippets into
 /etc/aide/aide.conf.d.

Description: 2d dogfight game - data files
 Airstrike is a 2d dogfight game in the tradition of the Intellivision and
 Amiga games 'Biplanes' and 'BIP'. It features a robust physics engine and
 several other extensions of the original games. It is currently 0-2 player
 only, but will hopefully have network play and some more advanced computer
 controlled enemies in the future. The graphics have been created using the
 Povray raytracer, and should be easy to extend and modify.
 .
 This package contains the architecture-independent data files.

Description: Interactive sky atlas for astronomical images and datasets
 Aladin is an interactive software sky atlas allowing the user to
 visualise digitised astronomical images, to superimpose entries from
 astronomical catalogues or databases, and to interactively access
 related data and information from the Simbad database, the VizieR
 service and other archives for all known sources in the field.
 .
 Created in 1999 by the Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg
 (CDS), Aladin has become a widely-used tool of the Virtual
 Observatory (VO) framework capable of addressing challenges such as
 locating data of interest, accessing and exploring distributed
 datasets, and visualising multi-wavelength data. Compliance with
 existing or emerging VO standards, interconnection with other
 visualisation or analysis tools, and the ability to easily compare
 heterogeneous data are the key topics which allow Aladin to be a
 powerful data exploration and integration tool.

Description: lightweight database migration tool for SQLAlchemy
 Alembic is a new database migration tool, written by the author
 of SQLAlchemy. A migration tool offers the following functionality:
 .
  * Can emit ALTER statements to a database in order to change the
    structure of tables and other constructs
  * Provides a system whereby "migration scripts" may be constructed;
    each script indicates a particular series of steps that can
    "upgrade" a target database to a new version, and optionally a
    series of steps that can "downgrade" similarly, doing the same
    steps in reverse.
  * Allows the scripts to execute in some sequential manner.
 .
 This package provides /usr/bin/alembic script and documentation for Alembic,
 and depends on the python3-alembic package which contains all the actual code
 (in Python 3) for Alembic to actually work.

Description: Interpolated Variable Order Motifs to identify horizontally acquired DNA
 Alien_hunter is an application for the prediction of putative
 Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) events with the implementation of
 Interpolated Variable Order Motifs (IVOMs). An IVOM approach
 exploits compositional biases using variable order motif distributions
 and captures more reliably the local composition of a sequence compared
 to fixed-order methods. Optionally the predictions can be parsed into a
 2-state 2nd order Hidden Markov Model (HMM), in a change-point detection
 framework, to optimize the localization of the boundaries of the
 predicted regions. The predictions (embl format) can be automatically
 loaded into Artemis genome viewer freely available at:

Description: tiny DNS server for IPv6 Reverse DNS
 AllKnowingDNS provides reverse DNS for IPv6 networks which use SLAAC
 (autoconf), e.g. for a /64 network.
 .
 The problem with IPv6 reverse DNS and traditional nameservers is that the
 nameserver requires you to provide a zone file. Assuming you want to provide
 RDNS for a /64 network, you have 2**64 = 18446744073709551616 different usable
 IP addresses (a little less if you are using SLAAC). Providing a zone file for
 that, even in a very terse notation, would consume a huge amount of disk space
 and could not possibly be held in the memory of the computers available
 nowadays.
 .
 AllKnowingDNS instead generates PTR and AAAA records on the fly. You only
 configure which network you want to serve and what your entries should look
 like.

Description: AL Utilities REtooled (documentation)
 ALURE is a utility library to help manage common tasks with OpenAL
 applications. This includes device enumeration and initialization, file
 loading, and streaming.
 .
 The purpose of this library is to provide pre-made functionality that would
 otherwise be repetitive or difficult to (re)code for various projects and
 platforms, such as loading a sound file into an OpenAL buffer and streaming an
 audio file through a buffer queue. Support for different formats is consistent
 across platforms, so no special checks are needed when loading files, and all
 formats are handled through the same API.
 .
 Currently ALURE includes a basic .wav and .aif file reader, and can leverage
 external libraries such as libSndFile (for extended wave formats and several
 others), VorbisFile (for Ogg Vorbis), and FLAC (for FLAC and Ogg FLAC), and
 others. External libraries can also be dynamically loaded at run-time, or
 individually disabled outright at compile time.
 .
 This package installs the ALURE documentation.

Description: Interface between MTA and virus scanner/content filters
 AMaViSd-new is a script that interfaces a mail transport agent (MTA) with
 zero or more virus scanners, and spamassassin (optional).
 .
 It supports all common virus scanners (more than 20 different AVs), with
 direct talk-to-daemon support for ClamAV, OpenAntiVirus, Trophie, AVG,
 f-prot, and Sophos AVs.
 .
 AMaViSd-new supports all MTAs through its generic SMTP/LMTP filter mode
 (ideal for postfix and exim).  It is faster and safer to use the SMTP/LMTP
 filter mode than using the AMaViS pipe client.  It supports sendmail milter
 through the amavisd-new-milter package.

 It can be either used to anonymise existing log files, or directly by a service
 if it supports loging to shell pipes. Configuring the Apache httpd or nginx is
 very easy, so that unmasked IP  addresses are never  written to any file.

 With the help of cat, it's also possible to rewrite existing log files.

Description: Maven plugin for gUnit, a unit test framework for ANTLR grammars
 gUnit is a "Unit Test" framework for ANTLR grammars. It provides a simple
 way to write and run automated tests for ANTLR grammars in a manner similar
 to Java unit testing framework jUnit. The basic idea is to create a bunch of
 input/output pairs for rules in a grammar and gUnit will verify the expected
 output/result. The input can be a single line or multiple lines of strings or
 even an external file. The output can be simply success or failure, an
 abstract syntax tree (AST), a rule return value, or some text output which
 could be a rule's template return value. The current version of gUnit has 2
 main functions, interpreter and jUnit generator. The interpreter interprets
 your gUnit script and runs unit tests using Java reflection to invoke methods
 in your parser objects. The generator, on the other hand, translates your
 gUnit script to jUnit Java code that you can compile and execute by hand.
 .
 This package provides the Maven plugin that allows one to run gUnit tests
 during a Maven build.

 files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a
 grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.
 .
 This package provides the API documentation for ANTLR 4.

Description: Adaptive Poisson Boltzmann Solver
 APBS is a software package for the numerical solution of the
 Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE), one of the most popular continuum
 models for describing electrostatic interactions between molecular
 solutes in salty, aqueous media.  Continuum electrostatics plays an
 important role in several areas of biomolecular simulation, including:
 .
   * simulation of diffusional processes to determine ligand-protein and
     protein-protein binding kinetics,
   * implicit solvent molecular dynamics of biomolecules ,
   * solvation and binding energy calculations to determine
     ligand-protein and protein-protein equilibrium binding constants
     and aid in rational drug design,
   * and biomolecular titration studies.
 .
 APBS was designed to efficiently evaluate electrostatic properties for
 such simulations for a wide range of length scales to enable the
 investigation of molecules with tens to millions of atoms.
 .
 This package contains the apbs documentation.

Description: easy iptables based firewall system
 Advanced Policy Firewall (APF) is an iptables(netfilter) based firewall
 system designed around the essential needs of today's Internet deployed
 servers and the unique needs of custom deployed Linux installations. The
 configuration of APF is designed to be very informative and present the
 user with an easy to follow process, from top to bottom of the
 configuration file. The management of APF on a day-to-day basis is
 conducted from the command line with the 'apf' command, which includes
 detailed usage information and all the features one would expect from a
 current and forward thinking firewall solution.
 .
 Summary of features:
   * detailed and well commented configuration file
   * granular inbound and outbound network filtering
   * user id based outbound network filtering
   * application based network filtering
   * trust based rule files with an optional advanced syntax
   * global trust system where rules can be downloaded from a central
     management server
   * reactive address blocking (RAB), next generation in-line intrusion
     prevention
   * debug mode provided for testing new features and configuration setups
   * fast load feature that allows for 1000+ rules to load in under 1 second
   * inbound and outbound network interfaces can be independently configured
   * global tcp/udp port & icmp type filtering with multiple methods of
     executing filters (drop, reject, prohibit)
   * configurable policies for each ip on the system with convenience variables
     to import settings
   * packet flow rate limiting that prevents abuse on the most widely abused
     protocol, icmp
   * prerouting and postrouting rules for optimal network performance
   * dshield.org block list support to ban networks exhibiting suspicious
     activity
   * spamhaus Don't Route Or Peer List support to ban known "hijacked zombie"
     IP blocks
   * any number of additional interfaces may be configured as firewalled
     (untrusted) or trusted (not firewalled)
   * additional firewalled interfaces can have there own unique firewall
     policies applied
   * intelligent route verification to prevent embarrassing configuration
     errors
   * advanced packet sanity checks to make sure traffic coming and going meets
     the strictest of standards
   * filter attacks such as fragmented UDP, port zero floods, stuffed routing,
     arp poisoning and more
   * configurable type of service options to dictate the priority of different
     types of network traffic
   * intelligent default settings to meet every day server setups
   * dynamic configuration of your servers local DNS revolvers into the firewall
   * optional filtering of common p2p applications
   * optional filtering of private & reserved IP address space

Description: automatic generator of basic unit tests for a C/C++ library API
 API Sanity Checker is an automatic generator of basic unit tests for a C/C++
 library. It helps to quickly generate simple ("sanity" or "shallow" quality)
 tests for every function in an API using their signatures, data type
 definitions and relationships between functions straight from the library
 header files ("Header-Driven Generation"). Each test case contains a function
 call with reasonable (in most, but unfortunately not all, cases) input
 parameters. The quality of generated tests allows one to check absence of
 critical errors in simple use cases and can be greatly improved by involving of
 highly reusable specialized types for the library.
 .
 The tool can execute generated tests and detect crashes, aborts, all kinds of
 emitted signals, non-zero program return code, program hang‐ ing and
 requirement failures (if specified). The tool can be considered as a tool for
 out-of-box low-cost sanity checking of library API or as a test development
 framework for initial generation of templates for advanced tests. Also it
 supports universal Template2Code format of tests, splint specifications, random
 test generation mode and other useful features.

Description: command line tool to sign and verify Android APKs
 apksig is a project which aims to simplify APK signing and checking
 whether APK's signatures should verify on Android. apksig supports
 JAR signing (used by Android since day one) and APK Signature Scheme
 v2 (supported since Android Nougat, API Level 24).
 .
 The key feature of apksig is that it knows about differences in APK
 signature verification logic between different versions of the
 Android platform. apksig can thus check whether a signed APK is
 expected to verify on all Android platform versions supported by the
 APK. When signing an APK, apksig will choose the most appropriate
 cryptographic algorithms based on the Android platform versions
 supported by the APK being signed.
 .
 apksigner command-line tool offers two operations:
 .
  * sign the provided APK so that it verifies on all Android platforms
 supported by the APK. Run apksigner sign for usage information.
 .
  * check whether the provided APK's signatures are expected to verify
 on all Android platforms supported by the APK. Run apksigner verify
 for usage information.
 .
 The tool determines the range of Android platform versions (API
 Levels) supported by the APK by inspecting the APK's
 AndroidManifest.xml. This behavior can be overridden by specifying
 the range of platform versions on the command-line.

Description: Apophenia Statistical C Library -- reference manual
 The Apophenia Statistical C Library is an open source C library for
 working with data sets and statistical models. It provides functions
 on the same level as those of the typical stats packages (such as OLS,
 probit, or singular value decomposition) but gives the user more
 flexibility to be creative in model-building.
 .
 Apophenia is meant to scale well, to comfortably work with gigabyte
 data sets, million-step simulations, or computationally-intensive
 agent-based models.
 .
 Apophenia builds upon the GNU Scientific and SQLite libraries,
 MySQL/mariaDB is also supported. The core functions are written
 in C, but experience has shown them to be easy to bind in Python,
 Julia, Perl, Ruby, etc. The source code is distributed under the
 GNU General Public License version 2 (GPL2).
 .
 This package provides the reference manual for the Apophenia
 Statistical C Library; it also contains examples.

Description: Developer documentation for AppStream
 AppStream is a metadata specification which permits software components to
 provide information about themselves to automated systems and end-users
 before the software is actually installed.
 This permits informative displays of new applications to users in software
 centers, as well as allowing a system to make decisions on which new software
 a user might want to install (e.g. missing firmware or media handlers).
 .
 This package provides developer documentation for AppStream.

Description: Caching proxy server for Debian/Ubuntu/Devuan software repositories
 Apt-cacher performs caching of files requested by apt-get (or other APT clients
 such as aptitude or synaptic). Apt-cacher can also proxy Debian Bugs SOAP
 requests for apt-listbugs. It is most useful for local area networks with
 limited network bandwidth or to reduce multiple large downloads.
 .
 When a file or package is requested, apt-cacher checks whether it already has
 the requested version, in which case it fulfils the request immediately.  If
 not, it downloads the package while streaming it to the client at the same
 time. A local copy is then kept for any subsequent requests.
 .
 Apt-cacher has been optimized for best utilization of network bandwidth and is
 efficient even on slow or low-memory servers. Multiple ways of installation
 are possible: as a stand-alone proxy, as a daemon executed by inetd or as
 a CGI program (deprecated). Client machines are configured by changing APT's
 proxy configuration or modification of access URLs in sources.list.
 .
 The package includes utilities to clean the cache (removing obsolete package
 files), generate usage reports and import existing package files.  Optional
 features include a file checksum verification framework, IPv6 support, FTP and
 HTTPS (proxying only) support as well as the simultaneous caching of
 repositories from different distributions.
 .
 Apt-cacher can be used as a replacement for apt-proxy, with no need to modify
 client's /etc/apt/sources.list files (and even reusing its config and cached
 data), or as an alternative to approx.

Description: manage Debian source packages
 apt-src is a command line interface for downloading, installing, upgrading,
 and tracking Debian source packages. It makes source package management
 feel a lot like using apt to manage binary packages, and is being used as
 a testbed to work on adding source dependencies to Debian.
 .
 It can be run as a normal user, or as root. If you want a convenient way to
 track updates to packages while preserving your local modifications, this is
 a way to do that.

Description: APT transport for anonymous package downloads via Tor
 Provides support in APT for downloading packages anonymously via the Tor
 network.
 .
 APT already includes mechanisms for guaranteeing the authenticity of the
 packages you download.  However, an adversary sniffing your network traffic
 can still see what software you are installing.
 .
 Install apt-transport-tor, edit your sources.list to include only tor://
 URLs, and you can make it very difficult for anyone intercepting your
 network traffic to be able to tell that you are installing Debian packages,
 or which packages you are installing.
 .
 Please note that this approach is only as secure as Tor itself - this
 software cannot protect you from an attacker who has access to your local
 machine.  In addition, attackers may be able to correlate your network
 traffic with the packets coming out of an exit node, so do be careful.

Description: maintenance and search tools for a Xapian index of Debian packages
 This package provides update-apt-xapian-index, a tool to maintain a Xapian
 index of Debian package information in /var/lib/apt-xapian-index, and
 axi-cache, a command line search tool that uses the index.
 .
 axi-cache allows one to search packages very quickly, and it also interfaces
 with the shell command line completion in a smart way, providing
 context-sensitive keyword and tag suggestions even before the search command
 is actually run.
 .
 update-apt-xapian-index allows plugins to be installed in
 /usr/share/apt-xapian-index to index all sorts of extra information, such as
 Debtags tags, popcon information, package ratings and anything else that would
 fit.
 .
 The index generated by update-apt-xapian-index is self-documenting, as it
 contains an autogenerated README file with information on the index layout and
 all the data that can be found in it.

Description: specificity control for read alignments using an artificial reference
 ARDEN (Artificial Reference Driven Estimation of false positives in NGS
 data) is a novel benchmark that estimates error rates based on real
 experimental reads and an additionally generated artificial reference
 genome. It allows the computation of error rates specifically for a
 dataset and the construction of a ROC-curve. Thereby, it can be used to
 optimize parameters for read mappers, to select read mappers for a
 specific problem or also to filter alignments based on quality
 estimation.

 This package can find query parameters for URL endpoints.
 .
 Web applications use parameters (or queries) to accept user input, take the
 following example into consideration.
 .
    http://api.example.com/v1/userinfo?id=751634589
 .
 This URL seems to load user information for a specific user id, but what if
 there exists a parameter named admin which when set to True makes the endpoint
 provide more information about the user?
 This is what Arjun does, it finds valid HTTP parameters with a huge default
 dictionary of 25,890 parameter names.
 It takes less than 10 seconds to go through this huge list while making just
 50-60 requests to the target.
 .
 Some features:
   - Supports GET/POST/POST-JSON/POST-XML requests;
   - Automatically handles rate limits and timeouts;
   - Export results to: BurpSuite, text or JSON file;
   - Import targets from: BurpSuite, text file or a raw request file;
   - Can passively extract parameters from JS or 3 external sources.
 .
 Arjun is useful for penetration testing (PENTEST) and network security
 analysis, serving as OSINT.

Description: profiles for art simulation tools
 ART is a set of simulation tools to generate synthetic next-generation
 sequencing reads. ART simulates sequencing reads by mimicking real
 sequencing process with empirical error models or quality profiles
 summarized from large recalibrated sequencing data. ART can also
 simulate reads using user own read error model or quality profiles. ART
 supports simulation of single-end, paired-end/mate-pair reads of three
 major commercial next-generation sequencing platforms: Illumina's
 Solexa, Roche's 454 and Applied Biosystems' SOLiD. ART can be used to
 test or benchmark a variety of method or tools for next-generation
 sequencing data analysis, including read alignment, de novo assembly,
 SNP and structure variation discovery. ART was used as a primary tool
 for the simulation study of the 1000 Genomes Project . ART is
 implemented in C++ with optimized algorithms and is highly efficient in
 read simulation. ART outputs reads in the FASTQ format, and alignments
 in the ALN format. ART can also generate alignments in the SAM
 alignment or UCSC BED file format. ART can be used together with genome
 variants simulators (e.g. VarSim) for evaluating variant calling tools
 or methods.
 .
 This package contains profile data for art-nextgen-simulation-tools.

Description: outputs artificial FASTQ files derived from a reference genome
 ArtificialFastqGenerator takes the reference genome (in FASTA format) as
 input and outputs artificial FASTQ files in the Sanger format. It can
 accept Phred base quality scores from existing FASTQ files, and use them
 to simulate sequencing errors. Since the artificial FASTQs are derived
 from the reference genome, the reference genome provides a gold-standard
 for calling variants (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and
 insertions and deletions (indels)). This enables evaluation of a Next
 Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis pipeline which aligns reads to the
 reference genome and then calls the variants.

Description: documentation for ASL
 The Advanced Simulation Library (ASL) is a free and open source hardware
 accelerated multiphysics simulation platform (and an extensible general
 purpose tool for solving Partial Differential Equations).
 .
 Its computational engine is written in OpenCL and utilizes matrix-free
 solution techniques which enable extraordinarily high performance,
 memory efficiency and deployability on a variety of massively parallel
 architectures, ranging from inexpensive FPGAs, DSPs and GPUs up to
 heterogeneous clusters and supercomputers. The engine is hidden entirely
 behind simple C++ classes, so that no OpenCL knowledge is required from
 application programmers. Mesh-free, immersed boundary approach allows one
 to move from CAD directly to simulation drastically reducing pre-processing
 efforts and amount of potential errors.
 .
 ASL can be used to model various coupled physical and chemical phenomena and
 employed in a multitude of fields: computational fluid dynamics, virtual
 sensing, industrial process data validation and reconciliation, image-guided
 surgery, computer-aided engineering, design space exploration,
 crystallography, etc...
 .

Description: puzzle game for building molecules out of separate atoms -- data
 Atomix is an educational game designed for GNOME in which one has to
 build molecules, ranging from simple inorganic ones to some extremely
 complex organic ones, out of separate atoms.
 .
 The first levels can be rather easy, but added complexity always comes
 with the next level, so that several minutes (or much longer than that)
 can be spent on each single level.
 .
 This package contains the architecture independent files like levels and
 graphics for atomix.

Description: tool for managing file archives of various types
 atool is a script for managing file archives of various types (tar,
 tar+gzip, zip etc). The main command is probably aunpack,
 extracting files from an archive. It overcomes the dreaded "multiple
 files in archive root" problem by first extracting to a unique
 subdirectory, and then moving back the files if possible. aunpack
 also prevents local files from being overwritten by mistake.
 .
 Other commands provided are apack (create archives), als (list files
 in archives), and acat (extract files to standard out).

Description: integrated document editing environment for TeX etc.
 AUCTeX is a comprehensive customizable integrated environment for writing
 input files for TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt/Texinfo using GNU Emacs.  Currently
 XEmacs ships with its own AUCTeX version.
 .
 It supports processing source files by running TeX and related tools
 (such as output filters, post processors for generating indices and
 bibliographies, and viewers) from inside Emacs.  AUCTeX allows browsing
 through the errors reported by TeX, while it moves the cursor directly to
 the reported error, and displays some documentation for that particular
 error.  This will even work when the document is spread over several
 files.
 .
 AUCTeX can automatically indent LaTeX source, either line by line or for
 an entire document, and has a special outline feature which can greatly
 assist in getting an overview of a document.
 .
 AUCTeX is written entirely in Emacs Lisp, and may therefore be enhanced
 with new features for specific needs.  It comes with a large range of
 handy Emacs macros.  It is a GNU project, and documentation for all its
 features is accessible via the Emacs info browser.

Description: automatic detector of common APT proxy settings
 auto-apt-proxy installs itself as an APT proxy autodetector, and detects
 common setups by checking some hosts on the local network for well-known APT
 proxies such as apt-cacher-ng.
 .
 This package is most useful for development environments, and will Do The
 Right Thing for at least these cases:
 .
   * Build chroots, with a proxy running on the host system.
   * Docker/lxc containers, with a proxy running on the host system.
   * Virtual machines with NAT networking, with a proxy running on the host
     system.
   * Any other system, with a proxy running on its default gateway.
   * Systems where the `apt-proxy` hostname resolves to a valid IP address
     and a supported proxy is detected at that address.
 .
 The following APT proxy servers are supported and automatically detected:
   * apt-cacher-ng
   * approx
   * apt-cacher
   * squid-deb-proxy
   * any proxy advertised by an _apt_proxy._tcp SRV record in your domain
 .
 This package has a minimal set of dependencies in order to minimize the
 influence on systems where it is installed.
 .
 This package does not query mDNS SRV records, which would require avahi.
 If you need that, consider the `squid-deb-proxy-client` package instead.

Description: generates Dia UML diagrams from source code, XML or data
 AutoDia (Automatic Dia XML) is a modular application that parses source code,
 XML or data and produces an XML document in Dia format[1] (or images via
 graphviz and vcg).
 .
 Its goal is to be a UML/DB Schema diagram autocreation package. The diagrams
 its creates are standard UML diagrams showing dependencies, superclasses,
 packages, classes and inheritances, as well as the methods, etc of each class.
 .
 AutoDia supports any language that a Handler has been written for - see below
 for an up to date list.
 .
 Autodia now outputs the following formats:
   * Graphviz (using dot to generate jpg, png, etc)
   * dot
   * vcg
   * xvcg (using xvcg to output postscript, etc )
   * dia (using a new custom directed graph algorithm to layout diagrams)
   * HTML/XML/Anything (if you write your own template)
   * Experimental SpringGraph (native perl directed graphs similar to graphviz)
     now included
   * Experimental Umbrello XML/XMI (requires fixing)
 .
 Autodia now parses the following forms of input:
   * Perl
   * Python
   * PHP
   * Java (some issues with version 1.4) no longer fully supported (it used to
     work, Java broke its API's now it doesn't, fixes welcome)
   * C++
   * Torque (XML DB schema)
   * DBI (perl database interface handles)
   * SQL
   * Umbrello (experimental)
 .

 while the protein was kept rather ridgid. This latest version 4 also
 allows for a flexibility of selected sidechains of surface residues,
 i.e., takes the rotamers into account.

Description: Automatically import missing Python libraries
 Throughout the development of a Python program you continuously need to manage
 the Python import statements either because you need one new object or because
 you no longer need it. This means that you need to stop writing whatever you
 were writing, go to the top of the file, create or remove the import statement
 and then resume coding.
 .
 This workflow break is annoying and almost always unnecessary. 'autoimport'
 solves this problem if you execute it whenever you have an import error, for
 example by configuring your editor to run it when saving the file.

Description: shell extension to jump to frequently used directories
 autojump provides a faster way to navigate your filesystem, with a
 "cd command that learns".
 .
 It works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from
 the command line, and allows you to "jump" to frequently used directories by
 typing only a small pattern.
 .
 To use autojump, you need to configure your shell to source
 /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh on startup.

Description: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
 files called `Makefile.am'.
 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.16 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.11, and 1.15 did, so some previous versions are available as separate

Description: create a skeleton source package for a new program
 autoproject interviews the user, then creates a source package for
 a new program which follows the GNU programming standards. The new
 package uses autoconf to configure itself, and automake to create
 the Makefile.
 .
 The idea is that you execute autoproject just once when you start
 a new project.  It will ask a few questions, then create a new
 directory and populate it with standard files, customized for the
 new project.
 .
 Optionally, the new package will use a command line parser generator.
 Currently, autoproject supports two parser generators: clig by Harald
 Kirsch <kir@iitb.fhg.de> (see http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/software/), and
 autogen by Bruce Korb <bkorb@gnu.org> (see  http://autogen.sf.net/).

 A daemon to automatically suspend and wake up a system. Inactivity and wake up

 executes these checks, and if none of them indicated activity, the system is
 suspended and automatically woken up if necessary.
 .
 Autosuspend does not depend on X11 and desktop environments and is therefore
 specifically intended for (home) servers. Most available checks address these
 usage scenarios. Yet, also the X11 idle time can be used as a check to support
 graphical use cases.

Description: invoke your editor, with optional file:lineno handling
 All or almost all Unix editors support the syntax of "editor +42 file", to
 open the given file and start with the cursor at line 42.  Alas, the syntax
 programs that output such data use is different: either "file:42: Something"
 or "file:42:1: Something", :1 being a column number.
 .
 This wrapper will recognize such references and call your $EDITOR using the
 + notation.  Thus, once you see an error message, you can copy&paste the
 first word of it without having to manually adjust.  Especially if your
 mouse selection is configured to allow ':', it's a single triple-click
 (L+L+M), and still pretty handy if not.
 .
 If your editor allows multi-open, "e" can also handle pipelines such as:
 * git grep MEOW|e -:
 * make 2>&1 >/dev/null|grep error:|e -::
 .
 Also, because of its short name, it reduces the typing needed to start the
 editor by half if you use vi, by 80% if emacs or jstar -- and that's by far
 the most frequent command an Unix user does.

Description: Bookkeeping software for small and medium-size businesses
 EekBoek is a bookkeeping package for Dutch users; it creates reports such as
 a balance sheet ("Balans"), a general journal ("Journaal"), a general
 ledger ("Grootboek") and a VAT report ("BTW-aangifte").
 .
 Unlike other accounting software, EekBoek has a command-line interface: The
 EekBoek Shell (with tab completion).  It uses a database as back end: either
 PostgreSQL (using the eekboek-db-postgresql package) or SQLite.
 Interoperability is a key feature of EekBoek: editable text dumps of all your
 data are possible at any time.  EekBoek can generate an "XML Auditfile
 Financieel" (XAF) as used by Dutch tax office.  Furthermore, it has a
 complete Perl API to create your own custom applications.
 .
 The EekBoek documentation is available in Dutch only.
 .
 If you'd like to use EekBoek with a PostgreSQL back end (instead of the
 default SQLite), install the package eekboek-db-postgresql.
 If you'd like to use the Eekboek GUI, install the suggested package
 eekboek-gui.

Description: easy and flexible alerting with Elasticsearch
 This package contains a simple framework for alerting on anomalies, spikes, or
 other patterns of interest from data in Elasticsearch.
 .
 ElastAlert works with all versions of Elasticsearch.
 .
 If you have data being written into Elasticsearch in near real time and want to
 be alerted when that data matches certain patterns, ElastAlert is the tool for
 you.
 .
 ElastAlert is designed to be reliable, highly modular, and easy to set up and
 configure.
 .
 It works by combining Elasticsearch with two types of components, rule types
 and alerts.  Elasticsearch is periodically queried and the data is passed to
 the rule type, which determines when a match is found. When a match occurs, it
 is given to one or more alerts, which take action based on the match.
 .
 This is configured by a set of rules, each of which defines a query, a rule
 type, and a set of alerts.  .

Description: Easy to use Bitcoin client
 This package provides a lightweight Bitcoin client which protects
 you from losing your bitcoins in a backup mistake or computer
 failure. Also, Electrum does not require waiting time because it does
 not download the Bitcoin blockchain.
 .
 Features of Electrum:
 .
   * Instant on: Your client does not download the blockchain. It uses a
     network of specialized servers that index the blockchain.
   * Forgiving: Your wallet can be recovered from a secret seed.
   * Safe: Your seed and private keys are encrypted on your hard drive.
     They are never sent to the servers.
   * Low trust: Information received from the servers is verified using
     SPV. Servers are authenticated using SSL.
   * No downtimes: Your client is not tied to a particular server; it
     will switch instantly if your server is down.
   * Ubiquitous: You can use the same wallet on different computers, they
     will synchronize automatically.
   * Cold Storage: Sign transactions from a computer that is always
     offline. Broadcast them using a machine that does not have your keys.
   * Reachable: You can export your private keys into other Bitcoin
     clients.
   * Established: Electrum is open source and was first released in
     November 2011.

 elementary-xfce is a fork of the elementary OS icon theme for Xfce and other
 desktops.
 .
 This fork took place because the elementary OS maintainers wanted to focus
 exclusively on their desktop environment and thus dropped a lot of icon
 symlinks used by other desktops. elementary-xfce intends to keep these as-is,
 while still pulling in new icons and integrating them occasionally.

Description: functions for dealing with associative structures
 Library for dealing with associative data structures: alists,
 hash-maps, and vectors (for vectors, the indices are treated as
 keys).
 .
 This library is largely inspired by Clojure, it has many of the
 functions found in clojure.core, prefixed with `a-'. All functions
 treat their arguments as immutable, so e.g. `a-assoc' will clone the
 hash-table or alist it is given. Keep this in mind when writing
 performance sensitive code.

Description: dependently typed functional programming language — emacs mode
 Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language: It has inductive
 families, which are like Haskell's GADTs, but they can be indexed by values and
 not just types. It also has parameterised modules, mixfix operators, Unicode
 characters, and an interactive Emacs interface (the type checker can assist in
 the development of your code).
 .
 Agda is also a proof assistant: It is an interactive system for writing and
 checking proofs. Agda is based on intuitionistic type theory, a foundational
 system for constructive mathematics developed by the Swedish logician Per
 Martin-Löf. It has many similarities with other proof assistants based on
 dependent types, such as Coq, Epigram and NuPRL.
 .
 This package contains the emacs interactive development mode for Agda. This
 mode is the preferred way to write Agda code, and offers features such as
 iterative development, refinement, case analysis and so on.

Description: Emacs minor mode that reindents code after every change
 electric-indent-mode is enough to keep your code nicely aligned when
 all you do is type. However, once you start shifting blocks around,
 transposing lines, or slurping and barfing sexps, indentation is
 bound to go wrong.
 .
 aggressive-indent-mode is a minor mode that keeps your code always
 indented. It reindents after every change, making it more reliable
 than electric-indent-mode.

Description: test support functions for Emacs
 This package provides functions to support ert, the Emacs Regression
 Test framework. It includes:
 .
  * a set of predicates for comparing strings, buffers and file contents;
  * explainer functions for all predicates giving useful output;
  * macros for creating many temporary buffers at once, and for restoring
    the buffer list;
  * methods for testing indentation, by comparison or "round-tripping";
  * methods for testing fontification;
 .
 Assess aims to be a stateless as possible, leaving Emacs unchanged
 whether the tests succeed or fail, with respect to buffers, open
 files and so on; this helps to keep tests independent from each
 other. Violations of this will be considered a bug.
 .
 Assess aims also to be as noiseless as possible, reducing and
 suppressing extraneous messages where possible, to leave a clean ert
 output in batch mode.

 Atomic Chrome is an extension for the Chromium and Google Chrome
 browsers that allows one to edit text entry areas of a web-page in
 Emacs.  Atomic Chrome for Emacs also supports the use of GhostText
 Chromium and Chrome extension.
 .
 This package is similar to "Edit with Emacs"; however, it features
 two advantages over this alternative as a result of its websocket
 design:
   * Live update: The text entry area for which Atomic Chrome has been
     activated and its associated Emacs buffer are synchronised.
     Updates to one continuously propagate to the other.
   * Bidirectional communication: Edit text in either the browser
     or Emacs and difference is applied to the other half.
 .
 Firefox is also supported via the GhostText browser addon.

Description: automatic dictionary switcher for Emacs spell checking
 Auto-dictionary is a minor mode that hooks into Flyspell's on-the-fly spell
 checking and extends these checks to also detect language.  Auto-dictionary
 then sets 'ispell-dictionary' to use the detected language.  This package is
 useful for bilingual and multilingual Emacs users.
 .
 Language detection is per buffer (per document), and auto-dictionary will
 choose the language whose words appear most frequently in a document.  If that
 document also contains a second language, and then the document is edited until
 there are a greater number of words from the second language, then
 auto-dictionary will choose the second language.  That is to say,
 auto-dictionary's pick always depends on the current state of the document, and
 it will only pick one language.  This package does not enable multiple
 dictionary support for Emacs ispell.
 .
 Auto-dictionary supports the following languages:
   * ca  - Catalan
   * da  - Dansk (Danish)
   * de  - Deutsch (German)
   * el  - νέα ελληνικά (Modern Greek)
   * en  - English
   * eo  - Esperanto
   * es  - Español (Spanish)
   * fr  - Français (French)
   * grc - ἑλληνικά (Classical Greek)
   * hi  - हिन्दी (Hindi)
   * hu  - Magyar (Hungarian)
   * nb  - Bokmål (Norwegian)
   * nn  - Nynorsk (Norwegian)
   * pt  - Português (Portuguese)
   * ro  - Românâ, Româneşte (Romanian)

Description: jump to things in Emacs tree-style
 This package provides a generic completion method based on building
 a balanced decision tree with each candidate being a leaf.  To
 traverse the tree from the root to a desired leaf, typically a
 sequence of `read-key' can be used.
 .
 In order for `read-key' to make sense, the tree needs to be
 visualized appropriately, with a character at each branch node.  So
 this completion method works only for things that you can see on
 your screen, all at once:
 .
  * character positions
  * word or subword start positions
  * line beginning positions
  * link positions
  * window positions
 .
 If you're familiar with the popular `ace-jump-mode' package, this
 package does all that and more, without the implementation
 headache.

Description: bind personal keymaps in multiple locations
 `bind-map' is an Emacs package providing the macro bind-map which can
 be used to make a keymap available across different "leader keys"
 including ones tied to evil states. It is essentially a
 generalization of the idea of a leader key as used in vim or the
 Emacs `evil-leader' package, and allows for an arbitrary number of
 "leader keys". This is probably best explained with an example.

Description: Emacs client for Language Server Protocol servers
 This package provides a elisp library implementing a client for
 Language Server Protocol servers. It should need little or no
 configuration and be able to guess the LSP server to start for the
 language you're using. It only relies on elisp libraries developed in
 the Emacs mainline, and is seamlessly integrated with other core IDE
 functionalities (xref, project, completion-at-point, eldoc, flymake).

Description: Emacs Mini-Buffer Actions Rooted in Keymaps
 Embark makes it easy to choose an Emacs command to run based on what is near
 point, both during a minibuffer completion session and in normal buffers. Bind
 the command embark-act to a key and it acts like prefix-key for a keymap of
 actions (commands) relevant to the target around point. With point on an URL in
 a buffer you can open the URL in a browser or eww or download the file it
 points to. If while switching buffers you spot an old one, you can kill it
 right there and continue to select another. Embark comes preconfigured with
 over a hundred actions for common types of targets such as files, buffers,
 identifiers, s-expressions, sentences; and it is easy to add more actions and
 more target types. Embark can also collect all the candidates in a minibuffer
 to an occur-like buffer or export them to a buffer in a major-mode specific to
 the type of candidates, such as dired for a set of files, ibuffer for a set of
 buffers, or customize for a set of variables.

 styles include an Element-like one with usernames above groups of messages,
 as well as a classic, no-margins IRC style.  Messages may be optionally
 displayed with unique colors for each user (with customizable contrast),
 making it easier to follow conversations.  Timestamp headers are optionally
 displayed where a certain amount of time passes between events, as well as
 where the date changes.

 'auto-mode-alist activates MODE for FILE-REGEX, Eproject
 activates PROJECT-TYPE for FILES-IN-DIRECTORY, when
 PROJECT-TYPE-DEFINITION is true.  It also creates a customisable
 hook that is run whenever a file belonging to a project is visited.

Description: asynchronous tests for the Emacs ERT testing framework
 This library provides the `ert-deftest-async' function for defining
 asynchronous tests for Emacs Lisp addon packages.  The user supplies
 a list of callbacks, and the test fails if it is not the case that
 all of the callbacks have been called after a defined number of
 seconds.
 .
 See the GNU Emacs documentation for general information on writing
 test suites with ERT.

Description: major modes for editing Git configuration files
 This package provides several major modes for editing Git
 configuration files. The modes are:
 .
  * gitattributes-mode
  * gitconfig-mode
  * gitignore-mode
 .
 Each mode is defined in its own library by the same name. Loading
 `git-modes' causes all three libraries to be loaded, but you could
 also load the libraries individually.

Description: generic completion mechanism for Emacs
 Ivy is an acronym for Incremental Vertical completYon.  While it
 operates similarly to other completion schemes, such as
 Icomplete mode, Ivy aims to be more efficient, smaller, simpler, and
 smoother to use--yet highly customisable.
 .
 To try Ivy, call M-x ivy-mode.  A default installation of Ivy only
 includes the generic completion framework, plus completion for file
 and buffer names.
 .
 This package will not install all of Ivy/Swiper/Counsel.  For a
 full-featured experience please install "elpa-counsel", which will
 also install "elpa-swiper".  Hydra users will probably also want
 "elpa-ivy-hydra".
 .
 Counsel is an alternative to Ido, Anything, and Helm.

Description: memoization functions
 This package provides memoization functions. `memoize' accepts a
 symbol or a function. When given a symbol, the symbol's function
 definition is memoized and installed overtop of the original function
 definition. When given a function, it returns a memoized version of
 that function.
 .
 Memoization takes up memory, which should be freed at some point.
 Because of this, all memoization has a timeout from when the last
 access was.

Description: directory tree sidebar for Emacs that is like NERDTree for Vim
 NeoTree is a modern, themeable alternative to the Emacs builtins
 Dired and Speedbar.  Like Speedbar, it auto-refreshes without needing
 to type "g".  Like Dired, but unlike Speedbar, it creates a new
 window as a sidebar and not a whole new frame (eg: not a new X11
 application window with its own window decorations).  NeoTree shows a
 file system tree relative to the users' $HOME, where both Dired and
 Speedbar default to showing the contents of the current directory.
 Thus it provides a hierarchical rather than a modal view.
 .
 Neotree is similar to Vim's NERDTree plugin.
 .
 This addon is for users who are more comfortable with the directory
 tree sidebar/file system explorer used in most non-Emacs applications.

Description: Emacs key and popup interface for complex keybindings
 Taking inspiration from prefix keys and prefix arguments, Transient
 implements a similar abstraction involving a prefix command, infix
 arguments and suffix commands. This abstraction could be called
 "transient command", but because it always involves at least two
 commands (a prefix and a suffix) it's preferable to call it just a
 "transient".
 .
 When the user calls a transient prefix command, then a transient
 (temporary) keymap is activated, which binds the transient's infix
 and suffix commands, and functions that control the transient state
 are added to `pre-command-hook' and `post-command-hook'. The
 available suffix and infix commands and their state are shown in
 the echo area until the transient is exited by invoking a suffix
 command.
 .
 Calling an infix command causes its value to be changed, possibly
 by reading a new value in the minibuffer.
 .
 Calling a suffix command usually causes the transient to be exited
 but suffix commands can also be configured to not exit the
 transient state.

Description: Emacs minor mode for handling undo history as tree
 Package undo-tree provided by this package replaces Emacs' undo
 system with a system that treats undo history as what it is: a
 branching tree of changes. This simple idea allows the more intuitive
 behaviour of the standard undo/redo system to be combined with the
 power of never losing any history. An added side bonus is that undo
 history can in some cases be stored more efficiently, allowing more
 changes to accumulate before Emacs starts discarding history.

Description: speech output interface to Emacs
 Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow someone who
 cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.
 .
 Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs. Once Emacs is started with Emacspeak
 loaded, users get spoken feedback for all actions. As Emacs can do
 everything, they get speech feedback for everything they do.
 .
 This package recommends the speech server for the espeak (software)
 speech synthesizer, so it should work straight away. However it also
 contains the source for speech servers to support the DECtalk Express
 and DECtalk MultiVoice (hardware) speech synthesizers. For other
 synthesizers, look for speech server packages such as emacspeak-ss and
 eflite.

 In Enigma, your objective is to locate and uncover matching pairs of
 Oxyd stones. Simple as it sounds, this task is made more difficult by
 the fact that Oxyd stones tend to be hidden, inaccessible or protected
 by unexpected traps. Overcoming these obstacles often requires a lot
 of dexterity and wit (and can be quite addictive).

 This package contains the data files (levels, graphics, sounds).

Description: Circumvent Debian package dependencies
 This package provides a tool to create trivial Debian packages.
 Typically these packages contain only dependency information, but they
 can also include normal installed files like other packages do.
 .
 One use for this is to create a metapackage: a package whose sole
 purpose is to declare dependencies and conflicts on other packages so
 that these will be automatically installed, upgraded, or removed.
 .
 Another use is to circumvent dependency checking: by letting dpkg
 think a particular package name and version is installed when it
 isn't, you can work around bugs in other packages' dependencies.
 (Please do still file such bugs, though.)

 All key material is created on the user's computer and never stored or
 transferred to the server.
 .
 All data is locally encrypted (including the file name). The encrypted
 data (and only that!) is stored in the cloud. The data remains secure even
 if the cloud server is compromised. It does not need root or superuser
 privileges. No need to run your own server. All you need is the bash
 script (literally). It is one single command to add and use a
 file system:

Description: Quantum chemistry program for large-scale calculations - data package
 ErgoSCF is a quantum chemistry program for large-scale self-consistent field
 calculations.  It employs modern linear scaling techniques like fast multipole
 methods, hierarchic sparse matrix algebra, density matrix purification, and
 efficient integral screening.  Linear scaling is achieved not only in terms of
 CPU usage but also memory utilization.  It uses Gaussian basis sets.
 .
 It can compute single-point energies for the following methods:
  * Restricted and unrestricted Hartree-Fock (HF) theory
  * Restricted and unrestricted Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT)
  * Full Configuration-Interaction (FCI)
 .
 The following Exchange-Correlational (XC) density functionals are included:
  * Local Density Approximation (LDA)
  * Gradient-corrected (GGA) XC functionals BLYP, BP86, PW91 and PBE
  * Hybrid XC functionals B3LYP, BHandHLYP, PBE0 and CAMB3LYP
 .
 Further features include:
  * Linear response calculations (polarizabilities and excitation energies) for
    restricted reference densities
  * External electric fields
  * Electron dynamics via Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF)
 .
 This package contains data for ergo.

Description: AST-based pattern checker for JavaScript
 ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns
 found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
 In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint
 with a few exceptions:
 .
  * ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing
  * ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code
  * ESLint is completely pluggable,
    every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime
 .
 Some uses of ESLint require additional packages:
  * Use of parsers other than the default (Espree) require that parser,
    e.g. node-babel-eslint, node-esprima, or node-esprima-fb.
  * Use of option --init require package node-inquirer.

Description: ESO VLT Instrument pipeline collection
 In collaboration with the various instrument consortia, the Pipeline Systems
 Department has undertaken to implement data reduction pipelines for the most
 commonly used VLT/VLTI instrument modes.  These data reduction pipelines have
 three main purposes:
 .
  * Data quality control: Pipelines are used to produce the quantitative
    information necessary to monitor instrument performance.
 .
  * Master calibration product creation: pipelines are used to produce master
    calibration products (e.g. combined bias frames, super-flats, wavelength
    dispersion solutions).
 .
  * Science product creation: using pipeline-generated master calibration
    products, science products are produced for supported instrument modes
    (e.g. combined ISAAC jitter stacks; bias-corrected, flat-fielded FORS
    images, wavelength-calibrated UVES spectra). The accuracy of the science
    products can be limited both by the quality of the available master
    calibration products and by the algorithmic implementation of the
    pipelines themselves. In particular, adopted reduction strategies may not
    be suitable for all scientific goals.
 .
 This metapackage will install all ESO VLT pipelines along with the
 environments needed to run them (esorex, python-cpl).

Description: small and non-interactive scripting language (documentation)
 Execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language, like sh; but its
 syntax is quite different from a traditional shell syntax. The execlineb
 program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text file; the other
 commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb script.
 .
 Execline is as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops,
 getopt-style option handling, filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile, its
 syntax is far more logic and predictable than the shell's syntax, and has
 no security issues.
 .

Description: configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration
 for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split
 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.

Description: Extra modules and scripts for CMake
 Extra CMake Modules, or ECM, aims to augment CMake with additional modules. It
 serves as both a staging ground for new modules before they are moved upstream
 to CMake and a place for modules that, for whatever reason, are not a good fit
 for CMake itself.
 .
 It is primarily driven by the needs of the KDE community, but it is hoped that
 other projects will find it useful, and outside contributions are always
 welcome. The main rule for new modules is that there must be at least two
 downstream users.
 .
 This package contains HTML documentation and man pages.

 .
 The extrepo package tries to remedy this, by providing a curated list
 of external repositories that can be enabled by a simple command,
 allowing unsigned scripts to be replaced by a simple "extrepo enable
 example.com_repo".
 .
 Note, however, that while the repositories are curated, and that any
 repositories with malicious content will be removed and/or disabled
 when detected, no warranty is made by the Debian project as to the
 security or quality of the software in these third-party repositories.

Description: semantic web reasoning engine
 Euler Yet another proof Engine (EYE) is a reasoning engine
 supporting the Semantic Web layers.
 It performs semibackward chaining and it supports Euler paths.
 Via N3 it is interoperable with Cwm.
 .
 Semibackward chaining
 is backward chaining for rules using <= in N3
 and forward chaining for rules using => in N3.
 This can be seen in EYE Reasoning.
 .
 Euler paths are roughly "don't step in your own steps"
 which is inspired by what Leonhard Euler discovered in 1736
 for the Königsberg Bridge Problem.
 EYE sees the rule P => C as P & NOT(C) => C.
 .
 Notation3 (N3) is a shorthand non-XML serialization
 of Resource Description Framework (RDF) models,
 designed with human-readability in mind:
 N3 is much more compact and readable than XML RDF notation.
 .
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model
 for data interchange on the Web.

 text terminal, same as nearly half a century ago.

Description: graphical user interface to EMBOSS
 EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially developed for
 the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user community. The software
 automatically copes with data in a variety of formats and even allows
 transparent retrieval of sequence data from the web. Also, as extensive
 libraries are provided with the package, it is a platform to allow other
 scientists to develop and release software in true open source spirit. EMBOSS
 also integrates a range of currently available packages and tools for sequence
 analysis into a seamless whole. EMBOSS breaks the historical trend towards
 commercial software packages.
 .
 Jemboss is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to EMBOSS, the European Molecular
 Biology Open Software Suite. It is part of the EMBOSS distribution.

 deprecated features are not used (without actually removing
 such declarations, which would break binary compatibility.)

Description: library for checking accessibility in ODF/ODT documents using Libreoffice
 AccessODF is an extension that can be used in OpenOffice.org Writer and in
 LibreOffice Writer. It enables authors to find and repair accessibility issues
 in their documents, i.e.  issues that make their documents difficult or even
 impossible to read for people with disabilities. This includes issues such as:
  * insufficient colour contrast between text and background,
  * missing text alternatives for images and other objects (such text
    alternatives are necessary for blind users and other users of
    text-to-speech software),
  * missing language identification for the document and for language changes
    inside the document (language information is needed for conversion into
    Braille and synthetic speech),
  * the use of proper Heading styles instead of big bold text to identify
    headings (this enables document navigation based on headings),
  * the use of proper tables instead of visually mimicking tables by using tabs
    or spaces,
  * the compatibility of images with DAISY, the de-facto standard for digital
    talking books.
 For each accessibility issue, AccessODF provides a description and repair
 suggestions.
 .
 This package just contains the library for use in other programs.

Description: Examples for the ADIOS Adaptable IO system
 The Adaptable IO System (ADIOS) provides a simple, flexible way for scientists
 to describe the data in their code that may need to be written, read,
 or processed outside of the running simulation. By providing an external
 to the code XML file describing the various elements, their types, and
 how you wish to process them this run, the routines in the host code
 (either Fortran or C) can transparently change how they process the data.

Description: API to handle application configuration through Java properties file
 OWNER was written because the code dealing with the configuration is
 frequently repetitive, redundant, it’s made of static classes, singletons,
 long list of methods just doing conversion from a string property to a named
 method returning a Java primitive or a basic Java object.
 .
 OWNER solves the problem providing an interface object that
  - is easy to mock, easy to pass to other objects (via dependency injection);
  - declaratively maps the configuration without any redundancy;
  - can easily expand the loading logic in order to have multiple configuration
  files, multiple level of overriding (global configuration, user-level,
  defaults, etc);
  - doesn’t need to have an actual properties file backing the configuration,
  if one uses @DefaultValue.
  - provides a lot of features, like hot reloading, variables expansion, etc;
  - leaves one free to do everything one is already doing with
  java.util.Properties;
  - does support a super powerful type conversion, which includes arrays,
  collections, many standard Java objects, and even the possibility to plug
  one's own conversion logic.

Description: JDK/API verification tools
 Animal Sniffer provides tools to assist verifying that classes compiled with a
 newer JDK/API are compatible with an older JDK/API.
 .
 The Java Boot Classpath Detector is an executable jar file which tries to
 determine the boot classpath of the Java Runtime and outputs that classpath to
 the standard output.
 .
 Animal Sniffer Annotations provides Java 1.5+ annotations which allow marking
 methods which Animal Sniffer should ignore signature violations of. Animal
 Sniffer is designed to detect when you have used classes/methods/fields which
 are not part of the JRE that you are targeting. There are certain situations
 when you might be compiling with a newer JDK than the JRE you are targeting.
 .
 The Animal Sniffer ANT Tasks can be used to build signatures of APIs and to
 check your classes against previously generated signatures.
 .
 The Animal Sniffer Enforcer Rule is used to check your classes against
 previously generated signatures.
 .
 The Animal Sniffer Maven Plugin is used to build signatures of APIs and to
 check your classes against previously generated signatures.

Description: Unit Test framework for ANTLR grammars
 gUnit is a "Unit Test" framework for ANTLR grammars. It provides a simple
 way to write and run automated tests for ANTLR grammars in a manner similar
 to Java unit testing framework jUnit. The basic idea is to create a bunch of
 input/output pairs for rules in a grammar and gUnit will verify the expected
 output/result. The input can be a single line or multiple lines of strings or
 even an external file. The output can be simply success or failure, an
 abstract syntax tree (AST), a rule return value, or some text output which
 could be a rule's template return value. The current version of gUnit has 2
 main functions, interpreter and jUnit generator. The interpreter interprets
 your gUnit script and runs unit tests using Java reflection to invoke methods
 in your parser objects. The generator, on the other hand, translates your
 gUnit script to jUnit Java code that you can compile and execute by hand.

Description: MIME and RFC822 parser for Java
 mime4j provides a parser, MimeStreamParser, for e-mail message streams in
 plain rfc822 and MIME format. The parser uses a callback mechanism to report
 parsing events such as the start of an entity header, the start of a body,
 etc.
 If you are familiar with the SAX XML parser interface you should have no
 problem getting started with mime4j.

Description: machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text
 The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
 processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks,
 such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named
 entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks
 are usually required to build more advanced text processing services. OpenNLP
 also included maximum entropy and perceptron based machine learning.

Description: library to sign and verify Android APKs
 apksig is a project which aims to simplify APK signing and checking
 whether APK's signatures should verify on Android. apksig supports
 JAR signing (used by Android since day one) and APK Signature Scheme
 v2 (supported since Android Nougat, API Level 24).
 .
 The key feature of apksig is that it knows about differences in APK
 signature verification logic between different versions of the
 Android platform. apksig can thus check whether a signed APK is
 expected to verify on all Android platform versions supported by the
 APK. When signing an APK, apksig will choose the most appropriate
 cryptographic algorithms based on the Android platform versions
 supported by the APK being signed.
 .
 apksig library offers three primitives:
 .
  * ApkSigner which signs the provided APK so that it verifies on all
 Android platform versions supported by the APK. The range of platform
 versions can be customized if necessary.
 .
  * ApkVerifier which checks whether the provided APK is expected to
 verify on all Android platform versions supported by the APK. The
 range of platform versions can be customized if necessary.
 .
  * (Default)ApkSignerEngine which abstracts away signing an APK from
 parsing and building an APK file. This is useful in optimized APK
 building pipelines, such as in Android Plugin for Gradle, which need
 to perform signing while building an APK, instead of after. For
 simpler use cases where the APK to be signed is available upfront,
 the ApkSigner above is easier to use.
 .
 NOTE: Some public classes of the library are in packages having the
 word “internal” in their name. These are not public API of the
 library. Do not use *.internal.* classes directly.

Description: Perl module for configuration file and command line handling
 AppConfig is a bundle of Perl5 modules for reading configuration
 files and parsing command line arguments.  Note that writing
 configuration files is not supported at this time.
 .
 AppConfig supports a relaxed configuration file syntax with support
 for flags (booleans), single and multivalue (lists or hashes)
 items.  A defined default and validation routine or regex can be
 defined for each option.
 .
 Environment variable, file variable and tilde (~) are supported and
 may be applied to selected configuration options.  For long blocks of
 text you can also use Perl HEREDOC syntax.  Additionally there is
 also a mechanism to utilise all these same features via a CGI.

Description: C++ header-only command line processing library
 So many different command line processing libraries out there and none
 of them just work! Some bring their whole extended family of related and
 unrelated external dependencies (yes, I'm looking at you Boost). Some
 require quirky syntax and/or very verbose setups that sacrifice
 simplicity for the generation of a cute usage message and validation.
 Many come to dominate your main() file and yet others do not build on
 multiple platforms - for some even their own tests and trivial usage
 cause crashes on some systems. Argh!
 .
 If you're writing a highly-sophisticated command line tool, then
 Boost.Program_options and its kind might give you many advanced options.
 However, if you need to get up and running quickly, effectively and with
 minimal fuss, give the single header-file argh a try.

Description: Library for parsing GNU style command line arguments (documentation)
 Argtable is an ANSI C library for parsing GNU style command line arguments.
 It enables a program's command line syntax to be defined in the source code as
 an array of argtable structs. The command line is then parsed according to that
 specification and the resulting values are returned in those same structs where
 they are accessible to the main program. Both tagged (-v, --verbose, --foo=bar)
 and untagged arguments are supported, as are multiple instances of each
 argument. Syntax error handling is automatic and the library also provides the
 means for displaying the command line syntax directly from the array of
 argument specifications.
 .
 This package contains the documentation for the development libraries for the
 libargtable2-dev package.

Description: Java bytecode manipulation framework
 ASM is an all purpose Java bytecode manipulation and analysis framework.
 It can be used to modify existing classes or dynamically generate classes,
 directly in binary form. Provided common transformations and analysis
 algorithms allow one to easily assemble custom complex transformations
 and code analysis tools.
 .
 ASM offer similar functionality as other bytecode frameworks, but it is
 focused on simplicity of use and performance. Because it was designed and
 implemented to be as small and as fast as possible, it makes it very
 attractive for using in dynamic systems.

 .
 From the draft W3C specification:
 .
 SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a decentralized,
 distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol that consists of three
 parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a message
 and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of
 application-defined datatypes, and a convention for representing remote
 procedure calls and responses.
 .
 This project is a follow-on to the Apache SOAP project.

Description: type-safe, non-general API that covers RDF 1.1
 Commons RDF aims to provide a common library for RDF 1.1 with implementations
 for common Java RDF frameworks like RDF4J, Apache Jena as well as for other
 libraries such as OWLAPI, Clerezza and other JVM languages.
 .
 The main motivation behind this simple library is to revise an historical
 incompatibility issue between these toolkits. This library does not pretend to
 be a generic API wrapping those libraries, but is a set of common Java
 interfaces for the RDF 1.1 concepts, e.g. 'IRI', 'BlankNode', 'Graph',
 accompanied with unit test cases for their expected behaviour, and a 'simple'
 implementation, which main purpose is to clarify the tests and interfaces.

Description: configuration to enable the Debian debug info server
 This package asks if it should enable use of the Debian debug info
 server with debugging tools that use libdebuginfo such as GDB.
 .
 When this is allowed by the sysadmin, a snippet will be added to the
 shell configuration. You will need to restart your shell after
 installing this package before the snippet will work.
 .
 The Debian debug info server will be contacted every time debugging
 tools attempt to look up debug info for binaries or libraries but the
 server does not log requests for debug info.
 .
 The Debian debug info server uses https to securely transfer debugging
 files but does not offer OpenPGP signing of debug info.

Description: Eclipse Help System Core
 The Platform User Assistance component provides the mechanisms for making the
 Eclipse applications easier to use. These mechanisms are made available
 throughout usage life cycle and include initial user experience (welcome),
 online documentation, dynamic help, search, cheat sheets, automation and
 samples.
 .
 The goal of this component is to make it easier for users to accomplish their
 tasks in Eclipse applications. While it includes the traditional book-based
 help system, increasing effort is spent towards bringing assistance closer to
 the user. Welcome, dynamic help view and cheat sheets are examples of user
 assistance vehicles that can be used that way.

Description: Eclipse Java Compiler Tool Support
 Eclipse JDT Core is the Java infrastructure of the Eclipse Java IDE.
 It includes:
  * An incremental Java compiler. Implemented as an Eclipse builder, it is based
    on technology evolved from VisualAge for Java compiler. In particular, it
    allows one to run and debug code which still contains unresolved errors.
  * A Java Model that provides API for navigating the Java element tree.
    The Java element tree defines a Java centric view of a project. It surfaces
    elements like package fragments, compilation units, binary classes, types,
    methods, fields.
  * A Java Document Model providing API for manipulating a structured Java
    source document.
  * Code assist and code select support.
  * An indexed based search infrastructure that is used for searching, code
    assist, type hierarchy computation, and refactoring. The Java search engine
    can accurately find precise matches either in sources or binaries.
  * Evaluation support either in a scrapbook page or a debugger context.
  * Source code formatter
 .

  * Package Explorer View - shows the Java element tree as defined
    by a project's build class path
  * Type Hierarchy View - shows the sub- and supertype hierarchies
  * Java Outline View - shows the structure of a Java compilation unit
    or class file
  * Java Browsing Perspecitve - allows navigating the Java model using
    separate views for projects, packages, types and members.
  * Wizards for creating Java elements - Java project, package, class,
    interface
  * Java Editor - syntax coloring, content specific code assist, code
    resolve, method level edit, import assistance, quick fix and quick
    assist
 .
 In addition to these workbench elements the following functions are provided:
  * Refactoring support - Extract Method, Safe Rename and Moving with
    reference updates, Self Encapsulate Field etc.
  * Java searching - find declarations of and/or references to packages,
    types, methods, and fields, scoped to the workspace, a working set,
    or the current selection.
  * Java aware structured compare - determine and present changes to
    individual Java methods. It supports to replace individual Java elements
    with a version of an element from the local history.

Description: Eclipse SWTChart creates different types of charts
 The API allows one to create Line, Bar and Scatter charts easily. Size,
 colors, axes, ranges and all aspects of the charts can be modified via
 code. It is easy to create customized charts. The library already contains
 data compression to show large data sets in a performant way. Charts can be
 created even more easily with the SWTChart extensions. It uses the convention
 over configuration pattern and offers many additional improvements to scale
 axes of different type automatically or to select specific data ranges.

 EscapeVelocity has no facilities for HTML escaping and it is not appropriate
 for producing HTML output that might include portions of untrusted input.

 checking proofs. Agda is based on intuitionistic type theory, a foundational
 system for constructive mathematics developed by the Swedish logician Per
 Martin-Löf. It has many similarities with other proof assistants based on
 dependent types, such as Coq, Epigram and NuPRL.

Description: Android Plugin for Gradle
 The Android build system uses the Android Plugin for Gradle to support building
 Android applications with the Gradle build toolkit. The plugin runs independent
 of Android Studio so the plugin and the Gradle build system can be updated
 independently of Android Studio. You can build your Android applications from
 within Android Studio or from the command line on your machine or on machines
 where Android Studio is not installed (such as continuous integration servers).
 .
 This package does not include gradle-experimental.jar because its dependencies
 are hard to resolve in Debian.
 .
 To build an Android application using the plugin in Debian, install
 `android-debian-helper` and use the init.gradle provided by that package.

Description: lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser
 It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends) as your template
 language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's
 components clearly and succinctly. It automatically synchronizes data from
 your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data
 binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to
 test, AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and
 inversion of control. It also helps with server-side communication, taming
 async callbacks with promises and deferreds; and make client-side navigation
 and deeplinking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a piece of cake.

Description: Logging library for java
 log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of
 output targets.
 .
 It is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application
 binary. The log4j package is designed so that log statements can remain in
 shipped code without incurring a high performance cost.
 .
 One of the distinctive features of log4j is the notion of hierarchical
 loggers. Using loggers it is possible to selectively control which log
 statements are output at arbitrary granularity.
 .
 Log4j can output to: a file, a rolling file, a database with a JDBC driver,
 many output  asynchronously, a JMS Topic, a swing based logging console,
 the NT event log, /dev/null, a SMTP server (using javamail), a socket server,
 syslog, telnet daemon and stdout.
 .
 The format of the output can be defined using one of the various layout
 (or user defined layout) like: simple text, html, date, pattern defined and
 XML.

Description: Apache Log4j - Logging Framework for Java
 Apache Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements
 over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x:
 .
 API Separation: The API for Log4j is separate from the implementation making
 it clear for application developers which classes and methods they can use
 while ensuring forward compatibility.
 .
 Improved Performance: Log4j 2 contains next-generation Asynchronous Loggers
 based on the LMAX Disruptor library. In multi-threaded scenarios Asynchronous
 Loggers have 10 times higher throughput and orders of magnitude lower latency
 than Log4j 1.x.
 .
 Support for multiple APIs: While the Log4j 2 API will provide the best
 performance, Log4j 2 provides support for the SLF4J and Commons Logging APIs.
 .
 Automatic Reloading of Configurations: Log4j 2 can automatically reload its
 configuration upon modification. It will do so without losing log events
 while reconfiguration is taking place.
 .
 Advanced Filtering: Log4j 2 supports filtering based on context
 data, markers, regular expressions, and other components in the Log event.
 Filtering can be specified to apply to all events before being passed to
 Loggers or as they pass through Appenders.
 .
 Plugin Architecture: Log4j uses the plugin pattern to configure components.
 As such, no code is needed to create and configure an Appender, Layout,
 Pattern Converter, and so on. Log4j automatically recognizes plugins
 and uses them when a configuration references them.
 .
 Property Support: Properties can be referenced in a configuration, Log4j will
 directly replace them, or Log4j will pass them to an underlying component that
 will dynamically resolve them. Properties come from values defined in the
 configuration file, system properties, environment variables, the
 ThreadContext Map, and data present in the event.

Description: minimal AMD API implementation for use in optimized browser builds
 Some developers like to use the AMD API to code modular JavaScript,
 but after doing an optimized build, they do not want to include a
 full AMD loader like RequireJS, since they do not need all that
 functionality.
 .
 In the context of Javascript modules, AMD refers to a format
 specification which makes modules  easier to use. See
 http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#amd
 .
 Some use cases, like mobile, are very sensitive to file sizes.
 .
 By including almond in the built file, there is no need for
 RequireJS.  almond is around **1 kilobyte** when minified with
 Closure Compiler and gzipped.

Description: manage callbacks in asyncio projects
 Signal is a list of registered asynchronous callbacks.
 .
 The signal's life-cycle has two stages: after creation its content
 could be filled by using standard list operations: `sig.append()` etc.
 .
 After you call `sig.freeze()` the signal is frozen: adding, removing
 and dropping callbacks is forbidden.
 .
 The only available operation is calling the previously registered
 callbacks by using `await sig.send(data)`.

 aioxmlrpc is based on aiohttp for the transport, and just patch
 the necessary from the Python standard library to get it working.
 .
 Example of usage:
 .
  import asyncio
  from aioxmlrpc.client import ServerProxy
 .
  @asyncio.coroutine
  def print_gandi_api_version():
      api = ServerProxy('https://rpc.gandi.net/xmlrpc/')
      result = yield from api.version.info()
      print(result)
 .
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
      loop.run_until_complete(print_gandi_api_version())
      loop.stop()

Description: Distributed tracing instrumentation for asyncio application with zipkin
 aiozipkin is a Python module that adds distributed tracing
 capabilities from asyncio applications with zipkin (http://zipkin.io)
 server instrumentation.
 .
 zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data
 needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures.
 It manages both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkin’s
 design is based on the Google Dapper paper.
 .
 Applications are instrumented with  aiozipkin report timing data to
 zipkin. The Zipkin UI also presents a Dependency diagram showing how
 many traced requests went through each application. If you are
 troubleshooting latency problems or errors, you can filter or sort all
 traces based on the application, length of trace, annotation, or
 timestamp.

Description: lightweight database migration tool for SQLAlchemy - Python module
 Alembic is a new database migration tool, written by the author
 of SQLAlchemy. A migration tool offers the following functionality:
 .
  * Can emit ALTER statements to a database in order to change the
    structure of tables and other constructs
  * Provides a system whereby "migration scripts" may be constructed;
    each script indicates a particular series of steps that can
    "upgrade" a target database to a new version, and optionally a
    series of steps that can "downgrade" similarly, doing the same
    steps in reverse.
  * Allows the scripts to execute in some sequential manner.

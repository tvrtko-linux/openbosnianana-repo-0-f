Description: close gaps in genomic alignments from short reads
 ABACAS (Algorithm Based Automatic Contiguation of Assembled Sequences)
 intends to rapidly contiguate (align, order, orientate), visualize and
 design primers to close gaps on shotgun assembled contigs based on a
 reference sequence.
 .
 ABACAS uses MUMmer to find alignment positions and identify syntenies
 of assembled contigs against the reference. The output is then processed
 to generate a pseudomolecule taking overlapping contigs and gaps in to
 account. ABACAS generates a comparison file that can be used to
 visualize ordered and oriented contigs in ACT. Synteny is represented by
 red bars where colour intensity decreases with lower values of percent
 identity between comparable blocks. Information on contigs such as the
 orientation, percent identity, coverage and overlap with other contigs
 can also be visualized by loading the outputted feature file on ACT.

Description: package for electronic structure calculations (Data files)
 ABINIT is a package whose main program allows one to find the total energy,
 charge density and electronic structure of systems made of electrons and
 nuclei (molecules and periodic solids) within Density Functional Theory (DFT),
 using pseudopotentials and a planewave basis.
 .
 ABINIT also includes options to optimize the geometry according to the DFT
 forces and stresses, or to perform molecular dynamics simulations using these
 forces, or to generate dynamical matrices, Born effective charges, and
 dielectric tensors. Excited states can be computed within the Time-Dependent
 Density Functional Theory (for molecules), or within Many-Body Perturbation
 Theory (the GW approximation). In addition to the main ABINIT code, different
 utility programs are provided.
 .
 This package contains a set of pseudopotentials and example inputs.

Description: package for electronic structure calculations (Documentation)
 ABINIT is a package whose main program allows one to find the total energy,
 charge density and electronic structure of systems made of electrons and
 nuclei (molecules and periodic solids) within Density Functional Theory (DFT),
 using pseudopotentials and a planewave basis.
 .
 ABINIT also includes options to optimize the geometry according to the DFT
 forces and stresses, or to perform molecular dynamics simulations using these
 forces, or to generate dynamical matrices, Born effective charges, and
 dielectric tensors. Excited states can be computed within the Time-Dependent
 Density Functional Theory (for molecules), or within Many-Body Perturbation
 Theory (the GW approximation). In addition to the main ABINIT code, different
 utility programs are provided.
 .
 This package contains the documentation and tutorials.

Description: synchronizes musical applications on multiple devices - development
 Ableton Link, a technology that synchronizes musical beat, tempo, and phase
 across multiple applications running on one or more devices. Applications on
 devices connected to a local network discover each other automatically and form
 a musical session in which each participant can perform independently: anyone
 can start or stop while still staying in time. Anyone can change the tempo, the
 others will follow. Anyone can join or leave without disrupting the session.
 .
 Ableton Link is implemented as a header-only C++-library.
 This package contains the development files.

Description: The Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide
 An in-depth exploration of the art of shell scripting.
 .
 This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or
 programming, but progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced
 level of instruction ... all the while sneaking in little snippets
 of UNIX(R) wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for
 self-study, and a reference and source of knowledge on shell
 scripting techniques. The exercises and heavily-commented examples
 invite active reader participation, under the premise that the only
 way to really learn scripting is to write scripts.
 .
 This book is suitable for classroom use as a general introduction to
 programming concepts.

Description: autoconf like tool
 ACR is an autoconf like tool that allows you to create configure scripts for
 your programs. The main aim of this tool is to teach developers how to create
 portable builds of their tools, just using generic functions wrapped by acr to
 generate portable shellscript.
 .
 Pros:
   * Easy to learn / implement.
   * Faster/smaller final configure script.
   * Own syntax, not complex m4 macros.
   * Reverse engineering tool to recover .acr files from the final configure
     script.
   * Good documentation and tutorials.
   * vim syntax highlighting for configure.acr files
     ($PREFIX/share/acr/vim/install.sh)
   * Debugging support (-d)
   * Integrated support for java, bash, perl, Tcl, c, c++, ruby and Python.
   * Recursive configure script calls.
   * Progress bar in generation stage.
 .
 Cons:
   * Not recommended for huge projects
   * Slow script generation parsing huge configuration files
   * No automake replace. (just type clean makefiles and acr substs)
   * Not enough tested (only on free operating systems (Open|Net|Free|Dfly)BSD,
     GNU systems, and Darwin).

 This program searches for and removes remnant adapter sequences from High-
 Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data and (optionally) trims low quality
 bases from the 3' end of reads following adapter removal. AdapterRemoval
 can analyze both single end and paired end data, and can be used to
 merge overlapping paired-ended reads into (longer) consensus sequences.
 Additionally, the AdapterRemoval may be used to recover a consensus
 adapter sequence for paired-ended data, for which this information is
 not available.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 'Adduser' will choose UID and GID values that conform to Debian policy,
 create a home directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and
 automate setting initial values for the user's password, real name
 and so on.
 .
 'Deluser' can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.
 .
 'Adduser' and 'Deluser' are intended to be used by the local
 administrator in lieu of the tools from the 'useradd' suite, and
 they provide support for easy use from Debian package maintainer
 scripts, functioning as kind of a policy layer to make those scripts
 easier and more stable to write and maintain.

Description: aegisub language packages
 Originally created as tool to make typesetting, particularly in anime
 fansubs, a less painful experience, Aegisub has grown into a fully
 fledged, highly customizable subtitle editor.
 .
 It features a lot of convenient tools to help you with timing, typesetting,
 editing and translating subtitles, as well as a powerful scripting environment
 called Automation (originally mostly intended for creating karaoke effects,
 Automation can now be used much else, including creating macros and various
 other convenient tools).
 .
 This package contains language packages for the following languages:
 ca, cs, da, de, el, es, fa, fi, fr, hu, id, it, ja, ko, pl, pt_BR, pt_PT, ru,
 sr_RS, vi, zh_CN, zh_TW

Description: text-based authoring tool for HTML
 Aephea is an HTML authoring framework.  It enforces HTML well-formedness
 with a simpler and stricter syntax, provides useful extensions and
 abstractions as well as facilities for adding new ones, all in a single
 unified approach that stays close to HTML itself.  Some of Aephea's
 characteristics are a TeX-like syntax, dictionary stacks, iteration and a
 focus on styling via CSS.
 .
 PUD (Portable Unix Documentation) is shipped with Aephea.  It provides
 mini-languages for authoring Unix manual pages and FAQ documents with output
 both in HTML and troff.
 .
 Both Aephea and PUD are written in zoem, a high-level macro/programming
 language with character filtering capabilities.
 .
 If you'd like to generate manpages, but don't like troff syntax, and find
 Perl's POD too limited, Aephea's PUD is likely useful for you. If you like
 your documents to be available in both PDF and HTML, but find DocBook XML
 too heavyweight (and aren't really happy with Docbook XML's baroque default
 tagnames), you'll like PUD.

Description: Tagging script for notmuch mail
 The basic task of afew is to provide automatic tagging each time new
 mail is registered with notmuch. In a classic setup, you might call it
 after 'notmuch new' in an offlineimap post sync hook.
 .
 In addition to more elementary features such as adding tags based on
 email headers or maildir folders, handling killed threads and spam, it
 can do some heavy magic in order to /learn/ how to initially tag your
 mails based on their content.
 .
 In move mode, afew will move mails between maildir folders according to
 configurable rules that can contain arbitrary notmuch queries to match
 against any searchable attributes.

Description: "free form" document preparation system
 AFT is a document preparation system. It is mostly free form meaning that there

 ASCII text.
 .
 AFT has a few rules for structuring your document and these rules have more to
 do with formatting your text rather than embedding commands.
 .
 Right now, AFT produces pretty good (weblint-able) HTML, XHTML, LaTeX, lout and
 RTF. It can, in fact, be coerced into producing all types of output (e.g.
 roll-your-own XML). All that needs to be done is to edit a rule file. You can
 even customize your own HTML rule files for specialized output.

 (Private Use Area), and is meant to specify preferred glyph names for
 new fonts. Also included is the ITC Zapf Dingbats Glyph List, which is
 similar to AGL in that it maps glyph names to Unicode values for the
 purpose of deriving content, but only for the glyphs in the ITC Zapf
 Dingbats font.

Description: Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment - Common files
 AIDE is an intrusion detection system that detects changes to files on
 the local system. It creates a database from the regular expression rules
 that it finds from the config file. Once this database is initialized
 it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several
 message digest algorithms (md5, sha1, rmd160, tiger, haval, etc.) that are
 used to check the integrity of the file. More algorithms can be added
 with relative ease. All of the usual file attributes can also be checked
 for inconsistencies.
 .
 This package contains base and configuration files that are needed to
 run the actual binaries.
 .
 You will almost certainly want to tweak the configuration file in
 /etc/aide/aide.conf or drop your own config snippets into
 /etc/aide/aide.conf.d.

Description: 2d dogfight game - data files
 Airstrike is a 2d dogfight game in the tradition of the Intellivision and
 Amiga games 'Biplanes' and 'BIP'. It features a robust physics engine and
 several other extensions of the original games. It is currently 0-2 player
 only, but will hopefully have network play and some more advanced computer
 controlled enemies in the future. The graphics have been created using the
 Povray raytracer, and should be easy to extend and modify.
 .
 This package contains the architecture-independent data files.

Description: Interactive sky atlas for astronomical images and datasets
 Aladin is an interactive software sky atlas allowing the user to
 visualise digitised astronomical images, to superimpose entries from
 astronomical catalogues or databases, and to interactively access
 related data and information from the Simbad database, the VizieR
 service and other archives for all known sources in the field.
 .
 Created in 1999 by the Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg
 (CDS), Aladin has become a widely-used tool of the Virtual
 Observatory (VO) framework capable of addressing challenges such as
 locating data of interest, accessing and exploring distributed
 datasets, and visualising multi-wavelength data. Compliance with
 existing or emerging VO standards, interconnection with other
 visualisation or analysis tools, and the ability to easily compare
 heterogeneous data are the key topics which allow Aladin to be a
 powerful data exploration and integration tool.

Description: lightweight database migration tool for SQLAlchemy
 Alembic is a new database migration tool, written by the author
 of SQLAlchemy. A migration tool offers the following functionality:
 .
  * Can emit ALTER statements to a database in order to change the
    structure of tables and other constructs
  * Provides a system whereby "migration scripts" may be constructed;
    each script indicates a particular series of steps that can
    "upgrade" a target database to a new version, and optionally a
    series of steps that can "downgrade" similarly, doing the same
    steps in reverse.
  * Allows the scripts to execute in some sequential manner.
 .
 This package provides /usr/bin/alembic script and documentation for Alembic,
 and depends on the python3-alembic package which contains all the actual code
 (in Python 3) for Alembic to actually work.

Description: Interpolated Variable Order Motifs to identify horizontally acquired DNA
 Alien_hunter is an application for the prediction of putative
 Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) events with the implementation of
 Interpolated Variable Order Motifs (IVOMs). An IVOM approach
 exploits compositional biases using variable order motif distributions
 and captures more reliably the local composition of a sequence compared
 to fixed-order methods. Optionally the predictions can be parsed into a
 2-state 2nd order Hidden Markov Model (HMM), in a change-point detection
 framework, to optimize the localization of the boundaries of the
 predicted regions. The predictions (embl format) can be automatically
 loaded into Artemis genome viewer freely available at:

Description: tiny DNS server for IPv6 Reverse DNS
 AllKnowingDNS provides reverse DNS for IPv6 networks which use SLAAC
 (autoconf), e.g. for a /64 network.
 .
 The problem with IPv6 reverse DNS and traditional nameservers is that the
 nameserver requires you to provide a zone file. Assuming you want to provide
 RDNS for a /64 network, you have 2**64 = 18446744073709551616 different usable
 IP addresses (a little less if you are using SLAAC). Providing a zone file for
 that, even in a very terse notation, would consume a huge amount of disk space
 and could not possibly be held in the memory of the computers available
 nowadays.
 .
 AllKnowingDNS instead generates PTR and AAAA records on the fly. You only
 configure which network you want to serve and what your entries should look
 like.

Description: AL Utilities REtooled (documentation)
 ALURE is a utility library to help manage common tasks with OpenAL
 applications. This includes device enumeration and initialization, file
 loading, and streaming.
 .
 The purpose of this library is to provide pre-made functionality that would
 otherwise be repetitive or difficult to (re)code for various projects and
 platforms, such as loading a sound file into an OpenAL buffer and streaming an
 audio file through a buffer queue. Support for different formats is consistent
 across platforms, so no special checks are needed when loading files, and all
 formats are handled through the same API.
 .
 Currently ALURE includes a basic .wav and .aif file reader, and can leverage
 external libraries such as libSndFile (for extended wave formats and several
 others), VorbisFile (for Ogg Vorbis), and FLAC (for FLAC and Ogg FLAC), and
 others. External libraries can also be dynamically loaded at run-time, or
 individually disabled outright at compile time.
 .
 This package installs the ALURE documentation.

Description: Interface between MTA and virus scanner/content filters
 AMaViSd-new is a script that interfaces a mail transport agent (MTA) with
 zero or more virus scanners, and spamassassin (optional).
 .
 It supports all common virus scanners (more than 20 different AVs), with
 direct talk-to-daemon support for ClamAV, OpenAntiVirus, Trophie, AVG,
 f-prot, and Sophos AVs.
 .
 AMaViSd-new supports all MTAs through its generic SMTP/LMTP filter mode
 (ideal for postfix and exim).  It is faster and safer to use the SMTP/LMTP
 filter mode than using the AMaViS pipe client.  It supports sendmail milter
 through the amavisd-new-milter package.

 It can be either used to anonymise existing log files, or directly by a service
 if it supports loging to shell pipes. Configuring the Apache httpd or nginx is
 very easy, so that unmasked IP  addresses are never  written to any file.
 .
 With the help of cat, it's also possible to rewrite existing log files.

Description: Maven plugin for gUnit, a unit test framework for ANTLR grammars
 gUnit is a "Unit Test" framework for ANTLR grammars. It provides a simple
 way to write and run automated tests for ANTLR grammars in a manner similar
 to Java unit testing framework jUnit. The basic idea is to create a bunch of
 input/output pairs for rules in a grammar and gUnit will verify the expected
 output/result. The input can be a single line or multiple lines of strings or
 even an external file. The output can be simply success or failure, an
 abstract syntax tree (AST), a rule return value, or some text output which
 could be a rule's template return value. The current version of gUnit has 2
 main functions, interpreter and jUnit generator. The interpreter interprets
 your gUnit script and runs unit tests using Java reflection to invoke methods
 in your parser objects. The generator, on the other hand, translates your
 gUnit script to jUnit Java code that you can compile and execute by hand.
 .
 This package provides the Maven plugin that allows one to run gUnit tests
 during a Maven build.

 files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a
 grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.

Description: Adaptive Poisson Boltzmann Solver
 APBS is a software package for the numerical solution of the
 Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE), one of the most popular continuum
 models for describing electrostatic interactions between molecular
 solutes in salty, aqueous media.  Continuum electrostatics plays an
 important role in several areas of biomolecular simulation, including:
 .
   * simulation of diffusional processes to determine ligand-protein and
     protein-protein binding kinetics,
   * implicit solvent molecular dynamics of biomolecules ,
   * solvation and binding energy calculations to determine
     ligand-protein and protein-protein equilibrium binding constants
     and aid in rational drug design,
   * and biomolecular titration studies.
 .

Description: easy iptables based firewall system
 Advanced Policy Firewall (APF) is an iptables(netfilter) based firewall
 system designed around the essential needs of today's Internet deployed
 servers and the unique needs of custom deployed Linux installations. The
 configuration of APF is designed to be very informative and present the
 user with an easy to follow process, from top to bottom of the
 configuration file. The management of APF on a day-to-day basis is
 conducted from the command line with the 'apf' command, which includes
 detailed usage information and all the features one would expect from a
 current and forward thinking firewall solution.
 .
 Summary of features:
   * detailed and well commented configuration file
   * granular inbound and outbound network filtering
   * user id based outbound network filtering
   * application based network filtering
   * trust based rule files with an optional advanced syntax
   * global trust system where rules can be downloaded from a central
     management server
   * reactive address blocking (RAB), next generation in-line intrusion
     prevention
   * debug mode provided for testing new features and configuration setups
   * fast load feature that allows for 1000+ rules to load in under 1 second
   * inbound and outbound network interfaces can be independently configured
   * global tcp/udp port & icmp type filtering with multiple methods of
     executing filters (drop, reject, prohibit)
   * configurable policies for each ip on the system with convenience variables
     to import settings
   * packet flow rate limiting that prevents abuse on the most widely abused
     protocol, icmp
   * prerouting and postrouting rules for optimal network performance
   * dshield.org block list support to ban networks exhibiting suspicious
     activity
   * spamhaus Don't Route Or Peer List support to ban known "hijacked zombie"
     IP blocks
   * any number of additional interfaces may be configured as firewalled
     (untrusted) or trusted (not firewalled)
   * additional firewalled interfaces can have there own unique firewall
     policies applied
   * intelligent route verification to prevent embarrassing configuration
     errors
   * advanced packet sanity checks to make sure traffic coming and going meets
     the strictest of standards
   * filter attacks such as fragmented UDP, port zero floods, stuffed routing,
     arp poisoning and more
   * configurable type of service options to dictate the priority of different
     types of network traffic
   * intelligent default settings to meet every day server setups
   * dynamic configuration of your servers local DNS revolvers into the firewall
   * optional filtering of common p2p applications
   * optional filtering of private & reserved IP address space

Description: automatic generator of basic unit tests for a C/C++ library API
 API Sanity Checker is an automatic generator of basic unit tests for a C/C++
 library. It helps to quickly generate simple ("sanity" or "shallow" quality)
 tests for every function in an API using their signatures, data type
 definitions and relationships between functions straight from the library
 header files ("Header-Driven Generation"). Each test case contains a function
 call with reasonable (in most, but unfortunately not all, cases) input
 parameters. The quality of generated tests allows one to check absence of
 critical errors in simple use cases and can be greatly improved by involving of
 highly reusable specialized types for the library.
 .
 The tool can execute generated tests and detect crashes, aborts, all kinds of
 emitted signals, non-zero program return code, program hang‐ ing and
 requirement failures (if specified). The tool can be considered as a tool for
 out-of-box low-cost sanity checking of library API or as a test development
 framework for initial generation of templates for advanced tests. Also it
 supports universal Template2Code format of tests, splint specifications, random
 test generation mode and other useful features.

Description: command line tool to sign and verify Android APKs
 apksig is a project which aims to simplify APK signing and checking
 whether APK's signatures should verify on Android. apksig supports
 JAR signing (used by Android since day one) and APK Signature Scheme
 v2 (supported since Android Nougat, API Level 24).
 .
 The key feature of apksig is that it knows about differences in APK
 signature verification logic between different versions of the
 Android platform. apksig can thus check whether a signed APK is
 expected to verify on all Android platform versions supported by the
 APK. When signing an APK, apksig will choose the most appropriate
 cryptographic algorithms based on the Android platform versions
 supported by the APK being signed.
 .
 apksigner command-line tool offers two operations:
 .
  * sign the provided APK so that it verifies on all Android platforms
 supported by the APK. Run apksigner sign for usage information.
 .
  * check whether the provided APK's signatures are expected to verify
 on all Android platforms supported by the APK. Run apksigner verify
 for usage information.
 .
 The tool determines the range of Android platform versions (API
 Levels) supported by the APK by inspecting the APK's
 AndroidManifest.xml. This behavior can be overridden by specifying
 the range of platform versions on the command-line.

Description: Apophenia Statistical C Library -- reference manual
 The Apophenia Statistical C Library is an open source C library for
 working with data sets and statistical models. It provides functions
 on the same level as those of the typical stats packages (such as OLS,
 probit, or singular value decomposition) but gives the user more
 flexibility to be creative in model-building.
 .
 Apophenia is meant to scale well, to comfortably work with gigabyte
 data sets, million-step simulations, or computationally-intensive
 agent-based models.
 .
 Apophenia builds upon the GNU Scientific and SQLite libraries,
 MySQL/mariaDB is also supported. The core functions are written
 in C, but experience has shown them to be easy to bind in Python,
 Julia, Perl, Ruby, etc. The source code is distributed under the
 GNU General Public License version 2 (GPL2).
 .
 This package provides the reference manual for the Apophenia
 Statistical C Library; it also contains examples.

Description: Caching proxy server for Debian/Ubuntu/Devuan software repositories
 Apt-cacher performs caching of files requested by apt-get (or other APT clients
 such as aptitude or synaptic). Apt-cacher can also proxy Debian Bugs SOAP
 requests for apt-listbugs. It is most useful for local area networks with
 limited network bandwidth or to reduce multiple large downloads.
 .
 When a file or package is requested, apt-cacher checks whether it already has
 the requested version, in which case it fulfils the request immediately.  If
 not, it downloads the package while streaming it to the client at the same
 time. A local copy is then kept for any subsequent requests.
 .
 Apt-cacher has been optimized for best utilization of network bandwidth and is
 efficient even on slow or low-memory servers. Multiple ways of installation
 are possible: as a stand-alone proxy, as a daemon executed by inetd or as
 a CGI program (deprecated). Client machines are configured by changing APT's
 proxy configuration or modification of access URLs in sources.list.
 .
 The package includes utilities to clean the cache (removing obsolete package
 files), generate usage reports and import existing package files.  Optional
 features include a file checksum verification framework, IPv6 support, FTP and
 HTTPS (proxying only) support as well as the simultaneous caching of
 repositories from different distributions.
 .
 Apt-cacher can be used as a replacement for apt-proxy, with no need to modify
 client's /etc/apt/sources.list files (and even reusing its config and cached
 data), or as an alternative to approx.

Description: APT transport for anonymous package downloads via Tor
 Provides support in APT for downloading packages anonymously via the Tor
 network.
 .
 APT already includes mechanisms for guaranteeing the authenticity of the
 packages you download.  However, an adversary sniffing your network traffic
 can still see what software you are installing.
 .
 Install apt-transport-tor, edit your sources.list to include only tor://
 URLs, and you can make it very difficult for anyone intercepting your
 network traffic to be able to tell that you are installing Debian packages,
 or which packages you are installing.
 .
 Please note that this approach is only as secure as Tor itself - this
 software cannot protect you from an attacker who has access to your local
 machine.  In addition, attackers may be able to correlate your network
 traffic with the packets coming out of an exit node, so do be careful.

Description: maintenance and search tools for a Xapian index of Debian packages
 This package provides update-apt-xapian-index, a tool to maintain a Xapian
 index of Debian package information in /var/lib/apt-xapian-index, and
 axi-cache, a command line search tool that uses the index.
 .
 axi-cache allows one to search packages very quickly, and it also interfaces
 with the shell command line completion in a smart way, providing
 context-sensitive keyword and tag suggestions even before the search command
 is actually run.
 .
 update-apt-xapian-index allows plugins to be installed in
 /usr/share/apt-xapian-index to index all sorts of extra information, such as
 Debtags tags, popcon information, package ratings and anything else that would
 fit.
 .
 The index generated by update-apt-xapian-index is self-documenting, as it
 contains an autogenerated README file with information on the index layout and
 all the data that can be found in it.

Description: specificity control for read alignments using an artificial reference
 ARDEN (Artificial Reference Driven Estimation of false positives in NGS
 data) is a novel benchmark that estimates error rates based on real
 experimental reads and an additionally generated artificial reference
 genome. It allows the computation of error rates specifically for a
 dataset and the construction of a ROC-curve. Thereby, it can be used to
 optimize parameters for read mappers, to select read mappers for a
 specific problem or also to filter alignments based on quality
 estimation.

 flags prefixed by - (short) or -- (long) and aggregating them into easy
 to access structures with lots of convenience functions. It defers
 processing types until you access them, so the result structures end up
 just being pointers into the original command line argument C-strings.

Description: HTTP parameter discovery suite
 This package can find query parameters for URL endpoints.
 .
 Web applications use parameters (or queries) to accept user input, take the
 following example into consideration.
 .
    http://api.example.com/v1/userinfo?id=751634589
 .
 This URL seems to load user information for a specific user id, but what if
 there exists a parameter named admin which when set to True makes the endpoint
 provide more information about the user?
 This is what Arjun does, it finds valid HTTP parameters with a huge default
 dictionary of 25,890 parameter names.
 It takes less than 10 seconds to go through this huge list while making just
 50-60 requests to the target.
 .
 Some features:
   - Supports GET/POST/POST-JSON/POST-XML requests;
   - Automatically handles rate limits and timeouts;
   - Export results to: BurpSuite, text or JSON file;
   - Import targets from: BurpSuite, text file or a raw request file;
   - Can passively extract parameters from JS or 3 external sources.
 .
 Arjun is useful for penetration testing (PENTEST) and network security
 analysis, serving as OSINT.

Description: single- and multi-homed firewall script with DSL/ADSL support
 Unlike other lean iptables front ends in Debian, arno-iptables-firewall
 will setup and load a secure, restrictive firewall by just asking a few
 questions. This includes configuring internal networks for internet access
 via NAT and potential network services (e.g. HTTP or SSH).
 .
 However, it is in no way restricted to this simple setup. Some catch words
 of additional features, that can be enabled in the well documented
 configuration file are: DSL/ADSL, port forwarding, DMZ, port-scan detection,
 MAC address filtering.
 .
 Moreover, it comes with an extensive set of plugins to cover further
 requirements. For example SSH brute force protection, traffic shaping,
 traffic accounting, VPN support to just mention a few.

Description: Simplifies management of several Debian packages
 Arriero is a tool that allows simplifying the management of Debian packages,
 particularly useful when having to make new upstream releases, builds and
 uploads of similar packages.
 .
 It relies heavily in the use of git-buildpackage, and general git practices,
 so it's only useful for packages currently maintained through git.

Description: profiles for art simulation tools
 ART is a set of simulation tools to generate synthetic next-generation
 sequencing reads. ART simulates sequencing reads by mimicking real
 sequencing process with empirical error models or quality profiles
 summarized from large recalibrated sequencing data. ART can also
 simulate reads using user own read error model or quality profiles. ART
 supports simulation of single-end, paired-end/mate-pair reads of three
 major commercial next-generation sequencing platforms: Illumina's
 Solexa, Roche's 454 and Applied Biosystems' SOLiD. ART can be used to
 test or benchmark a variety of method or tools for next-generation
 sequencing data analysis, including read alignment, de novo assembly,
 SNP and structure variation discovery. ART was used as a primary tool
 for the simulation study of the 1000 Genomes Project . ART is
 implemented in C++ with optimized algorithms and is highly efficient in
 read simulation. ART outputs reads in the FASTQ format, and alignments
 in the ALN format. ART can also generate alignments in the SAM
 alignment or UCSC BED file format. ART can be used together with genome
 variants simulators (e.g. VarSim) for evaluating variant calling tools
 or methods.

Description: outputs artificial FASTQ files derived from a reference genome
 ArtificialFastqGenerator takes the reference genome (in FASTA format) as
 input and outputs artificial FASTQ files in the Sanger format. It can
 accept Phred base quality scores from existing FASTQ files, and use them
 to simulate sequencing errors. Since the artificial FASTQs are derived
 from the reference genome, the reference genome provides a gold-standard
 for calling variants (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and
 insertions and deletions (indels)). This enables evaluation of a Next
 Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis pipeline which aligns reads to the
 reference genome and then calls the variants.

Description: documentation for ASL
 The Advanced Simulation Library (ASL) is a free and open source hardware
 accelerated multiphysics simulation platform (and an extensible general
 purpose tool for solving Partial Differential Equations).
 .
 Its computational engine is written in OpenCL and utilizes matrix-free
 solution techniques which enable extraordinarily high performance,
 memory efficiency and deployability on a variety of massively parallel
 architectures, ranging from inexpensive FPGAs, DSPs and GPUs up to
 heterogeneous clusters and supercomputers. The engine is hidden entirely
 behind simple C++ classes, so that no OpenCL knowledge is required from
 application programmers. Mesh-free, immersed boundary approach allows one
 to move from CAD directly to simulation drastically reducing pre-processing
 efforts and amount of potential errors.
 .
 ASL can be used to model various coupled physical and chemical phenomena and
 employed in a multitude of fields: computational fluid dynamics, virtual
 sensing, industrial process data validation and reconciliation, image-guided
 surgery, computer-aided engineering, design space exploration,
 crystallography, etc...
 .
 This package contains the documentation.

 atool is a script for managing file archives of various types (tar,
 tar+gzip, zip etc). The main command is probably aunpack,
 extracting files from an archive. It overcomes the dreaded "multiple
 files in archive root" problem by first extracting to a unique
 subdirectory, and then moving back the files if possible. aunpack
 also prevents local files from being overwritten by mistake.
 .
 Other commands provided are apack (create archives), als (list files
 in archives), and acat (extract files to standard out).

Description: integrated document editing environment for TeX etc.
 AUCTeX is a comprehensive customizable integrated environment for writing
 input files for TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt/Texinfo using GNU Emacs.  Currently
 XEmacs ships with its own AUCTeX version.
 .
 It supports processing source files by running TeX and related tools
 (such as output filters, post processors for generating indices and
 bibliographies, and viewers) from inside Emacs.  AUCTeX allows browsing
 through the errors reported by TeX, while it moves the cursor directly to
 the reported error, and displays some documentation for that particular
 error.  This will even work when the document is spread over several
 files.
 .
 AUCTeX can automatically indent LaTeX source, either line by line or for
 an entire document, and has a special outline feature which can greatly
 assist in getting an overview of a document.
 .
 AUCTeX is written entirely in Emacs Lisp, and may therefore be enhanced
 with new features for specific needs.  It comes with a large range of
 handy Emacs macros.  It is a GNU project, and documentation for all its
 features is accessible via the Emacs info browser.

 Passwordless SSH using ssh identies or pubkeys can enable all
 sorts of wonderful automation, for example running unattended
 batch jobs, slurping down backups, or pushing out code.
 Unfortunately a key, once trusted, is allowed by default to run
 anything on that system, not just the small set of commands you
 actually need. If the key is compromised, you are at risk of a
 security breach.

 Authprogs is enabled by using the command= option in the

 auto-apt-proxy installs itself as an APT proxy autodetector, and detects
 common setups by checking some hosts on the local network for well-known APT
 proxies such as apt-cacher-ng.
 .
 This package is most useful for development environments, and will Do The
 Right Thing for at least these cases:
 .
   * Build chroots, with a proxy running on the host system.
   * Docker/lxc containers, with a proxy running on the host system.
   * Virtual machines with NAT networking, with a proxy running on the host
     system.
   * Any other system, with a proxy running on its default gateway.
   * Systems where the `apt-proxy` hostname resolves to a valid IP address
     and a supported proxy is detected at that address.
 .
 The following APT proxy servers are supported and automatically detected:
   * apt-cacher-ng
   * approx
   * apt-cacher
   * squid-deb-proxy
   * any proxy advertised by an _apt_proxy._tcp SRV record in your domain
 .
 This package has a minimal set of dependencies in order to minimize the
 influence on systems where it is installed.
 .
 This package does not query mDNS SRV records, which would require avahi.
 If you need that, consider the `squid-deb-proxy-client` package instead.

Description: generates Dia UML diagrams from source code, XML or data
 AutoDia (Automatic Dia XML) is a modular application that parses source code,
 XML or data and produces an XML document in Dia format[1] (or images via
 graphviz and vcg).
 .
 Its goal is to be a UML/DB Schema diagram autocreation package. The diagrams
 its creates are standard UML diagrams showing dependencies, superclasses,
 packages, classes and inheritances, as well as the methods, etc of each class.
 .
 AutoDia supports any language that a Handler has been written for - see below
 for an up to date list.
 .
 Autodia now outputs the following formats:
   * Graphviz (using dot to generate jpg, png, etc)
   * dot
   * vcg
   * xvcg (using xvcg to output postscript, etc )
   * dia (using a new custom directed graph algorithm to layout diagrams)
   * HTML/XML/Anything (if you write your own template)
   * Experimental SpringGraph (native perl directed graphs similar to graphviz)
     now included
   * Experimental Umbrello XML/XMI (requires fixing)
 .
 Autodia now parses the following forms of input:
   * Perl
   * Python
   * PHP
   * Java (some issues with version 1.4) no longer fully supported (it used to
     work, Java broke its API's now it doesn't, fixes welcome)
   * C++
   * Torque (XML DB schema)
   * DBI (perl database interface handles)
   * SQL
   * Umbrello (experimental)
 .

Description: test files for AutoDock
 AutoDock is a prime representative of the programs addressing the
 simulation of the docking of fairly small chemical ligands to rather big
 protein receptors. Earlier versions had all flexibility in the ligands
 while the protein was kept rather ridgid. This latest version 4 also
 allows for a flexibility of selected sidechains of surface residues,
 i.e., takes the rotamers into account.
 .
 This package contain the test files for the AutoDock program.

Description: Automatically import missing Python libraries
 Throughout the development of a Python program you continuously need to manage
 the Python import statements either because you need one new object or because
 you no longer need it. This means that you need to stop writing whatever you
 were writing, go to the top of the file, create or remove the import statement
 and then resume coding.
 .
 This workflow break is annoying and almost always unnecessary. 'autoimport'
 solves this problem if you execute it whenever you have an import error, for
 example by configuring your editor to run it when saving the file.

 .
 It works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from
 the command line, and allows you to "jump" to frequently used directories by
 typing only a small pattern.
 .
 To use autojump, you need to configure your shell to source
 /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh on startup.

Description: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from

 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back

 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.

 Automake 1.16 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.11, and 1.15 did, so some previous versions are available as separate

Description: create a skeleton source package for a new program
 autoproject interviews the user, then creates a source package for
 a new program which follows the GNU programming standards. The new
 package uses autoconf to configure itself, and automake to create
 the Makefile.

 The idea is that you execute autoproject just once when you start
 a new project.  It will ask a few questions, then create a new
 directory and populate it with standard files, customized for the
 new project.
 .
 Optionally, the new package will use a command line parser generator.
 Currently, autoproject supports two parser generators: clig by Harald
 Kirsch <kir@iitb.fhg.de> (see http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/software/), and
 autogen by Bruce Korb <bkorb@gnu.org> (see  http://autogen.sf.net/).

Description: extracts revision metadata from your VCS repository
 Extracts metadata about the current revision from your repository.
 This program is meant to be used by project build systems to extract
 properties that can be used in software version strings. Repository
 types supported include git, hg, bzr, and svn. It can create files
 containing variable and macro definitions suitable for a variety of
 programming languages and other info formats. Emitted information
 includes the ID of the most recent commit, its branch, its date,
 and several other useful pieces of meta-information. There is
 support for reading and writing a cache file so autorevision will
 remain useful during a build from an unpacked distribution tarball.

Description: daemon to suspend a system in case of inactivity
 A daemon to automatically suspend and wake up a system. Inactivity and wake up
 times are determined by a set of configurable checks. Autosuspend periodically
 executes these checks, and if none of them indicated activity, the system is
 suspended and automatically woken up if necessary.
 .
 Autosuspend does not depend on X11 and desktop environments and is therefore
 specifically intended for (home) servers. Most available checks address these
 usage scenarios. Yet, also the X11 idle time can be used as a check to support
 graphical use cases.

Description: low-maintenance backup/restore tool
 backup2l [backup-too-l] is a tool for autonomously generating, maintaining
 and restoring backups on a mountable file system (e. g. hard disk). In a
 default installation, backups are created regularly by a cron script.
 .
 The main design goals are low maintenance effort, efficiency, transparency
 and robustness. All control files are stored together with the archives on
 the backup device, and their contents are mostly self-explaining. Hence, a
 user can - if necessary - browse the files and extract archives manually.
 .
 backup2l features differential backups at multiple hierarchical levels.
 This allows one to generate small incremental backups at short intervals
 while at the same time, the total number of archives only increases
 logarithmically with the number of backups since the last full backup.
 .
 An open driver architecture allows one to use virtually any archiving
 program as a backend. Built-in drivers support .tar.gz, .tar.bz2 and others.
 Further user-defined drivers can be added.
 .
 An integrated split-and-collect function allows one to comfortably transfer
 all or selected archives to a set of CDs or other removable media.

Description: Bioinformatics Application for Navigating De novo Assembly Graphs Easily (data)
 Bandage is a GUI program that allows users to interact with the assembly
 graphs made by de novo assemblers such as Velvet, SPAdes, MEGAHIT and
 others.
 .
 De novo assembly graphs contain not only assembled contigs but
 also the connections between those contigs, which were previously not
 easily accessible. Bandage visualises assembly graphs, with connections,
 using graph layout algorithms. Nodes in the drawn graph, which represent
 contigs, can be automatically labelled with their ID, length or depth.
 Users can interact with the graph by moving, labelling and colouring
 nodes. Sequence information can also be extracted directly from the
 graph viewer. By displaying connections between contigs, Bandage opens
 up new possibilities for analysing and improving de novo assemblies that
 are not possible by looking at contigs alone.
 .
 More information and download links are on the Bandage website:
 rrwick.github.io/Bandage
 .
 The package contains some example data.

Description: BBTools genomic aligner and other tools for short sequences
 The BBTools are a collection of small programs to solve recurrent
 tasks for the creative handling of short biological RNA/DNA sequences.
 This suite may be best known for its mapper, which is also the name of
 the project on sourceforge, but several tools have been added over time.
 All tools are multi-threaded, implemented platform-independently in Java:
 .
 BBMap: Short read aligner for DNA and RNA-seq data. Capable of handling
 arbitrarily large genomes with millions of scaffolds. Handles Illumina,
 PacBio, 454, and other reads; very high sensitivity and tolerant of
 errors and numerous large indels.
 .
 BBNorm: Kmer-based error-correction and normalization tool.
 .
 Dedupe: Simplifies assemblies by removing duplicate or contained
 subsequences that share a target percent identity.
 .
 Reformat: Reformats reads between fasta/fastq/scarf/fasta+qual/sam,
 interleaved/paired, and ASCII-33/64, at over 500 MB/s.
 .
 BBDuk: Filters, trims, or masks reads with kmer matches to an
 artifact/contaminant file.

Description: font converter to generate console fonts from BDF source fonts
 This package provides a command-line converter that can be used in
 scripts to build console fonts from BDF sources automatically. The
 converter comes with a collection of font encodings that cover many
 of the world's languages. The output font can use a different
 character encoding from the input. When the source font does not
 define a glyph for a particular symbol in the encoding table, that
 glyph position in the console font is not wasted but used for another
 symbol.
 .
 When deciding about the position in the font for a particular glyph,
 the converter takes into account that in text video modes the video
 adapter copies the eighth column of the glyph matrix of symbols
 positioned in the pseudographic area to the ninth column. In order to
 create fonts for text video modes, the width of the glyph matrix of
 the source BDF font should be seven, eight, or nine pixels; otherwise the
 converter creates fonts suitable for framebuffer only.

Description: classic 2D point and click science fiction adventure game
 A science-fiction thriller set in a bleak post-apocalyptic vision
 of the future, Beneath a Steel Sky revolves around "Union City",
 where selfishness, rivalry, and corruption by its citizens seems to
 be all too common, those who can afford it live underground, away
 from the pollution and social problems which are plaguing the city.
 .
 You take on the role of Robert Foster, an outcast of sorts from the
 city since a boy who was raised in a remote environment outside of
 Union City simply termed "the gap".  Robert's mother took him away
 from Union City as a child on their way to "Hobart" but the helicopter
 crashed on its way, unfortunately Robert's mother dies, but he
 survives and is left to be raised by a local tribe from the gap.
 .
 Years later, Union City security drops by and abducts Robert, killing
 his tribe in the process; upon reaching the city the helicopter taking
 him there crashes with him escaping, high upon a tower block in the
 middle of the city he sets out to discover the truth about his past,
 and to seek vengeance for the killing of his tribe.
 .

Description: Gröbner bases in commutative and non-commutative algebras
 Bergman is a powerful tool to calculate Gröbner bases in commutative
 and non-commutative algebras, and in modules over them. It may also be
 used to calculate some invariants of algebras and modules: the Hilbert
 series, and (in the non-commutative case) the Poincaré-Betti series,
 the Anick resolution, and the Betti numbers.
 .
 The most important feature of bergman are computations both in
 non-commutative and commutative cases. It also permits degree-wise
 output of results; thus it may save partial results from calculations
 close to or beyond the limit for calculations of entire Gröbner bases
 with present-day computer strength. This saves for the user partial
 results even the problem overheads the strength of the computer.
 .
 Bergman offers the user a high level of flexibiliy. Among the
 alternatives for ring set-ups are: commutativity or non-commutativity;
 various strategies of Gröbner basis computation; a few different
 monomial orderings; and various coefficient fields. The set-up may be
 changed interactively during the session. Most calculations can be
 done both for ideals and modules. In the Reduce version it is possible
 to include indeterminates (with or without declared reduction rules)
 as coefficients for the commutative computations; otherwise the
 coefficient field should be a prime field.
 .
 Bergman is written in Standard Lisp, the Lisp dialect underlying
 Reduce implementations. There is also available an experimentative
 Common Lisp version.Therefore, bergman works under Reduce, PSL or
 Common Lisp (at least one of them should be pre-installed), and
 commands are written in respect to Reduce or Lisp syntax.

Description: Documentation for RNA-Seq tool eXpress
 This package provides a PDF with the documentation for eXpress.
 .
 eXpress is a streaming tool for quantifying the abundances of a set of
 target sequences from sampled subsequences. Example applications include
 transcript-level RNA-Seq quantification, allele-specific/haplotype
 expression analysis (from RNA-Seq), transcription factor binding
 quantification in ChIP-Seq, and analysis of metagenomic data. It is
 based on an online-EM algorithm that results in space (memory)
 requirements proportional to the total size of the target sequences and
 time requirements that are proportional to the number of sampled
 fragments. Thus, in applications such as RNA-Seq, eXpress can accurately
 quantify much larger samples than other currently available tools
 greatly reducing computing infrastructure requirements. eXpress can be
 used to build lightweight high-throughput sequencing processing
 pipelines when coupled with a streaming aligner (such as Bowtie), as
 output can be piped directly into eXpress, effectively eliminating the
 need to store read alignments in memory or on disk.
 .
 In an analysis of the performance of eXpress for RNA-Seq data, it was
 observed that this efficiency does not come at a cost of accuracy.
 eXpress is more accurate than other available tools, even when limited
 to smaller datasets that do not require such efficiency. Moreover, like
 the Cufflinks program, eXpress can be used to estimate transcript
 abundances in multi-isoform genes. eXpress is also able to resolve
 multi-mappings of reads across gene families, and does not require a
 reference genome so that it can be used in conjunction with de novo
 assemblers such as Trinity, Oases, or Trans-ABySS. The underlying model
 is based on previously described probabilistic models developed for
 RNA-Seq but is applicable to other settings where target sequences are
 sampled, and includes parameters for fragment length distributions,
 errors in reads, and sequence-specific fragment bias.
 .
 eXpress can be used to resolve ambiguous mappings in other
 high-throughput sequencing based applications. The only required inputs
 to eXpress are a set of target sequences and a set of sequenced
 fragments multiply-aligned to them.  While these target sequences will
 often be gene isoforms, they need not be. Haplotypes can be used as the
 reference for allele-specific expression analysis, binding regions for
 ChIP-Seq, or target genomes in metagenomics experiments. eXpress is
 useful in any analysis where reads multi-map to sequences that differ in
 abundance.

 Biber offers a large superset of BibTeX functionality for BibLaTeX
 users. In addition it offers full UTF-8 (Unicode 6.0) capabilities,
 fully customisable sorting, output to GraphViz to help visualise
 complex crossrefs, support for remote data sources, structural
 validation of the data against the (customisable) data model, and a
 lot more.

Description: Surface X-ray diffraction 2D detector data reduction
 BINoculars is a tool for data reduction and analysis of large sets of
 surface diffraction data that have been acquired with a
 two-dimensional X-ray detector. The intensity of each pixel of a
 two-dimensional detector is projected onto a three-dimensional grid
 in reciprocal-lattice coordinates using a binning algorithm. This
 allows for fast acquisition and processing of high-resolution data
 sets and results in a significant reduction of the size of the data
 set. The subsequent analysis then proceeds in reciprocal space. It
 has evolved from the specific needs of the ID03 beamline at the ESRF,
 but it has a modular design and can be easily adjusted and extended
 to work with data from other beamlines or from other measurement
 techniques.

Description: tool library for analyzing binary blobs and executable code
 Binwalk is a tool for searching a given binary image for embedded files
 and executable code. Specifically, it is designed for identifying files
 and code embedded inside of firmware images. Binwalk uses the libmagic
 library, so it is compatible with magic signatures created for the Unix
 file utility.
 .
 Binwalk also includes a custom magic signature file which contains
 improved signatures for files that are commonly found in firmware images
 such as compressed/archived files, firmware headers, Linux kernels,
 bootloaders, filesystems, etc.
 .
 This package is an empty package, because the binary tool is already
 provided with the library, dependency of this package.

Description: Examples for bio-eagle
 Eagle estimates haplotype phase either within a genotyped cohort or using a
 phased reference panel. The basic idea of the Eagle1 algorithm is to harness
 identity-by-descent among distant relatives—which is pervasive at very large
 sample sizes but rare among smaller numbers of samples—to rapidly call phase
 using a fast scoring approach. In contrast, the Eagle2 algorithm analyzes a
 full probabilistic model similar to the diploid Li-Stephens model used by
 previous HMM-based methods.

Description: Bison-style parser generator for C++ documentation
 Bisonc++ was designed after `bison++', created by Alain Coetmeur. Bisonc++
 adds to bison++ a cleaner class-design, using a base-class to communicate
 lexical tokens to a lexical scanner.
 .
 Since bisonc++ generates the parser class as well as the parsing
 function. The class can easily be provided with additional members without
 needing polymorphic functions. Consequently, classes generated by bisonc++
 have no virtual members and actually have but one public member: parse(),
 replacing the old-style bison and bison++ yyparse() function.
 .
 Bisonc++ offers many options, among which an option to define classes
 generated by bisonc++ in a separate namespace. This allows developers to
 define additional symbols, even outside of the class generated by bisonc++,
 without encountering name-collision problems. With bisonc++, artificial means
 to prevent name-collisions, like bison and bison++'s yy-convention are not
 required anymore when using bisonc++.  Bisonc++ merely generates C++ code. If
 C code is required, bison should be used. Bisonc++'s grammar requirements are
 highly compatible with bison's requirements, so converting a bison grammar
 into a bisonc++ grammar should be fairly simple.
 .
 In addition to the bisonc++ parser generator itself and several skeleton
 files, the package contains an extensive man-page, a full manual rewritten
 after the original bison manual, and several examples.
 .
 Some history: Bisonc++ versions 0.98 is a complete rewrite of an LALR(1)
 parser generator, as described in Aho, Sethi and Ullman's (1986) book
 `Compilers' (a.k.a. the `Dragon Book'). Version 0.98 was completed in May
 2005. Another major rewrite was completed one year later, May 2006, resulting
 in version 1.00.
 .
 This package provides the supplemental documentation for Bisonc++.

Description: build log hardening check
 Perl tool which checks build logs for missing hardening flags. Hardening
 flags enable additional security features in the compiler to prevent e.g.
 stack overflows, format string vulnerabilities, GOT overwrites, etc. See
 e.g. <http://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/SecurityHardeningBuildFlags>.
 .
 Because most build systems are quite complicated there are many places
 where compiler flags from the environment might be ignored. The parser
 verifies that all compiler commands use the correct hardening flags and
 thus all hardening features are correctly used.
 .
 It's designed to check build logs generated by Debian's dpkg-buildpackage
 (or tools for packaging, using dpkg-buildpackage like pbuilder or the
 official buildd build logs) to help maintainers detect missing hardening
 flags in their packages.
 .
 Only gcc is detected as compiler at the moment (but other compilers maybe
 supported).

 the command-line, via FTP, WebDAV, or anything else you might use to
 manipulate your files. There's no import or export; entries are
 nothing more complex than title on the first line, body being
 everything thereafter.

 Despite its tiny footprint, Blosxom doesn't skimp on features,
 sporting the majority of features one would find in any other Weblog
 application.  Additionally, Blosxom 2 includes support for plugins, and
 thus much more extensive customization.
 .
 Blosxom is simple, straightforward, minimalist Perl affording even the
 dabbler an opportunity for experimentation and customization. And
 last, but not least, Blosxom is open source and free for the taking
 and altering.

Description: Markup language for GTK user interface files
 GtkBuilder XML format is quite verbose, and many app developers don't like
 using WYSIWYG editors for creating UIs. Blueprint files are intended to be a
 concise, easy-to-read format that makes it easier to create and edit GTK UIs.
 Internally, it compiles to GtkBuilder XML as part of an app's build system. It
 adds no new features, just makes the features that exist more accessible.
 Another goal is to have excellent developer tooling--including a language
 server--so that less knowledge of the format is required. Hopefully this will
 increase adoption of cool advanced features like GtkExpression.

Description: Simulate and fit X-ray and neutron GISAS -- doc
 BornAgain is a software package to simulate and fit small-angle scattering at
 grazing incidence. It supports analysis of both X-ray (GISAXS) and neutron
 (GISANS) data. Calculations are carried out in the framework of the distorted
 wave Born approximation (DWBA). BornAgain provides a graphical user interface
 for interactive use as well as a generic Python and C++ framework for modeling
 multilayer samples with smooth or rough interfaces and with various types of
 embedded nanoparticles.
 .
 BornAgain supports:
 .
 Layers:
  * Multilayers without any restrictions on the number of layers
  * Interface roughness correlation
  * Magnetic materials
 .
 Particles:
  * Choice between different shapes of particles (form factors)
  * Particles with inner structures
  * Assemblies of particles
  * Size distribution of the particles (polydispersity)
 .
 Positions of Particles:
  * Decoupled implementations between vertical and planar positions
  * Vertical distributions: particles at specific depth in layers or on top.
  * Planar distributions:
    - fully disordered systems
    - short-range order distribution (paracrystals)
    - two- and one-dimensional lattices
 .
 Input Beam:
  * Polarized or unpolarized neutrons
  * X-ray
  * Divergence of the input beam (wavelength, incident angles) following
    different distributions
  * Possible normalization of the input intensity
 .
 Detector:
  * Off specular scattering
  * Two-dimensional intensity matrix, function of the output angles
 .
 Use of BornAgain:
  * Simulation of GISAXS and GISANS from the generated sample
  * Fitting to reference data (experimental or numerical)
  * Interactions via Python scripts or Graphical User Interface
 .

 includes the collection of tools for automatic updating the list of such
 hosts.
 .
 This package provides the shell script which periodically sends information
 about current IPv6 address to remote server and updates local /etc/hosts
 based on data received from that remote server. It is expected that
 bosixnet-webui is launched on that remote server.

Description: Examples for bowtie, the ultrafast memory-efficient short read aligner
 This package addresses the problem to interpret the results from the
 latest (2010) DNA sequencing technologies. Those will yield fairly
 short stretches and those cannot be interpreted directly. It is the
 challenge for tools like Bowtie to give a chromosomal location to the
 short stretches of DNA sequenced per run.
 .
 Bowtie aligns short DNA sequences (reads) to the human genome at a rate
 of over 25 million 35-bp reads per hour. Bowtie indexes the genome with
 a Burrows-Wheeler index to keep its memory footprint small: typically
 about 2.2 GB for the human genome (2.9 GB for paired-end).
 .
 This package provides some example data to work with bowtie.

Description: Examples for Bio++ program suite
 The Bio++ Program Suite is a package of programs using the Bio++
 libraries and dedicated to Phylogenetics and Molecular Evolution.  All
 programs are independent, but can be combined to perform rather complex
 analyses.  These programs use the interface helper tools of the
 libraries, and hence share the same syntax.  They also have several
 options in common, which may also be shared by third-party software.
 .
 This package contains some example data sets.

Description: fancy interface to the Python 3 interpreter
 bpython is a fancy interface to the Python interpreter, and has the
 following features:
 .
   * In-line syntax highlighting.
   * Readline-like autocomplete with suggestions displayed as you type
   * Expected parameter list for any Python function. Uses pydoc to attempt to
     divine params for C functions.
   * "Rewind" function to pop the last line of code from memory and re-evaluate.
     Note: this is only really useful when laying out classes and functions,
     since a true "undo" function is impossible, so be careful when using this.
   * Send the code you've entered off to a pastebin and display the pastebin URL
     for copying, etc.
   * Save the code you've entered to a file.
   * Auto-indentation.
   * Anti-Crash Mode.
 .

 will be executed, and success is determined based on their exit
 codes. "btest" comes with some additional tools that can be used
 within such tests to compare output against a previously established
 baseline.

Description: automate btrfs maintenance tasks on mountpoints or directories
 This is a set of scripts for the btrfs filesystem that automates the
 following maintenance tasks: scrub, balance, trim, and defragment.
 .
 Tasks are enabled, disabled, scheduled, and customised from a single text
 file.  The default configuration assumes an installation profile where '/'
 is a btrfs filesystem.
 .
 The default values have been chosen as an even compromise between time to
 complete maintenance, improvement in filesystem performance, and
 minimisation of resources taken from other processes.  Please note that I/O
 priority scheduling requires the use of BFQ or CFQ, and not noop, deadline,
 anticipatory, nor the new mq-deadline which uses blk-mq.

Description: System to automate the compile/test cycle (server)
 The BuildBot is a system to automate the compile/test cycle required
 by most software projects to validate code changes. By automatically
 rebuilding and testing the tree each time something has changed,
 build problems are pinpointed quickly, before other developers are
 inconvenienced by the failure. The guilty developer can be identified
 and harassed without human intervention.
 .
 By running the builds on a variety of platforms, developers who do
 not have the facilities to test their changes everywhere before
 checkin will at least know shortly afterwards whether they have
 broken the build or not. Warning counts, lint checks, image size,
 compile time, and other build parameters can be tracked over time,
 are more visible, and are therefore easier to improve.

Description: Version-bump your software with a single command
 A small command line tool to simplify releasing software by updating all
 version strings in your source code by the correct increment.
 .
 Also creates commits and tags:
  * version formats are highly configurable
  * works without any VCS, but happily reads tag information from and
    writes commits and tags to Git and Mercurial if available
  * just handles text files, so it's not specific to any programming
    language

Description: Decentralized configuration management system with Python
 By allowing for easy and low-overhead config management, BundleWrap fills
 the gap between complex deployments using Chef or Puppet and old school
 system administration over SSH.
 .
 While most other config management systems rely on a client-server
 architecture, BundleWrap works off a repository cloned to your local machine.
 .
 It then automates the process of SSHing into your servers and making sure
 everything is configured the way it's supposed to be. You won't have to
 install anything on managed servers.

Description: Provides syslogd and klogd using busybox
 The system log daemon is responsible for providing logging of
 messages received from programs and facilities on the local host as
 well as from remote hosts.
 .
 The kernel log daemon listens to kernel message sources and is
 responsible for prioritizing and processing operating system
 messages.
 .
 The busybox implementation of the syslogd is particular useful on
 embedded, diskless (netboot) or flash disk based systems because it
 can use a fixed size ring buffer for logging instead of saving logs
 to the disk or sending it to remote logging servers. The ring buffer
 can be read using the (also busybox based) command logread.
 .
 This package provides the glue to the busybox syslogd and klogd to be
 used in the system by providing the appropriate symbolic links and
 scripts.

Description: 3D first person tank battle game
 BZFlag is a 3D multi-player multiplatform tank battle game that allows users
 to play against each other in a network environment. There are five teams:
 red, green, blue, purple and rogue (rogue tanks are black). Destroying a
 player on another team scores a win, while being destroyed or destroying a
 teammate scores a loss. Rogues have no teammates (not even other rogues), so
 they cannot shoot teammates and they do not have a team score.
 .
 There are two main styles of play: capture-the-flag and free-for-all. In
 capture-the-flag, each team (except rogues) has a team base and each team with
 at least one player has a team flag. The object is to capture an enemy team's
 flag by bringing it to your team's base. This destroys every player on the
 captured team, subtracts one from that team's score, and adds one to your
 team's score. In free-for-all, there are no team flags or team bases. The
 object is simply to get as high a score as possible.
 .
 This metapackage installs both the client and the server, as well as generic
 documentation files concerning the bzflag community, contributing to bzflag,
 etc.

 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, data compressor.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: C->Haskell Interface Generator -- Documentation package
 C->Haskell is an interface generator that simplifies the development
 of Haskell bindings to C libraries.  The tool processes existing C
 header files that determine data layout and function signatures on
 the C side in conjunction with Haskell modules that specify
 Haskell-side type signatures and marshaling details.  Hooks embedded
 in the Haskell code signal access to C structures and functions --
 they are expanded by the interfacing tool in dependence on
 information from the corresponding C header file.
 .
 Haskell 98 is "the" standard lazy functional programming language.
 More info plus the language definition is at http://www.haskell.org/.
 .
 This package contains documentation for c2hs.

Description: powerful and easy to use e-book manager
 Calibre is a complete e-library solution. It includes library management,
 format conversion, news feeds to e-book conversion, e-book viewer and editor,
 and e-book reader sync features.
 .
 Calibre is primarily an e-book cataloging program. It manages your e-book
 collection for you. It is designed around the concept of the logical book,
 i.e. a single entry in the database that may correspond to e-books in several
 formats. It also supports conversion to and from a dozen different e-book
 formats.
 .
 Calibre supports almost every single e-Reader (e.g., Kindle, Kobo, Nook) and
 is compatible with more devices with every update. Calibre can transfer your
 e-books from one device to another in seconds, wirelessly or with a cable.
 It will send the best file format for your device converting it if
 needed, automatically.
 .
 Calibre can automatically fetch news from a number of websites/RSS feeds,
 format the news into a e-book and upload to a connected device.
 .
 Calibre has also a built-in e-book viewer that can display all the major e-book
 formats.

Description: SSL/TLS image proxy to prevent mixed-content warnings
 Camo is an image proxy to prevent mixed content warnings on secure
 pages.
 .
 It should not be installed by an end-user; instead people who operate
 websites that allow user-specified image embeds by URL can run this as
 a daemon to proxy such images through their own servers and serve the
 resulting content over SSL/TLS.
 .
 This provides integrity protection and last-mile confidentiality to
 images, thus preventing a local network attacker from seeing the images
 you request (allowing for possible disclosure of the content you're
 viewing) or changing their content (to misinform, confuse, or shock).
 .
 It of course does not prevent an attacker from modifying the content or
 noticing its access if the attacker is in the path between your
 datacentre and the image source.
 .
 However, even in this case, it provides some security insofar as it
 may prevent the attacker from knowing who is accessing the image.
 .
 Using a shared key, proxy URLs are encrypted with hmac so we can bust
 caches/ban/rate limit if needed.
 .
 Features include:
  * Proxy Google charts
  * Proxy images under 5 MB
  * Follow redirects to a configurable depth
  * Proxy remote images with a content-type of image/*
  * Disallows proxying to private IP ranges

Description: small Ruby web framework for Model-View-Controller type applications
 Camping is a web framework which consistently stays at less than 4kb of

 it as a Model-View-Controller application like Rails does. You can then
 easily move it to Rails once you've got it going.

Description: packaging and deployment tool for Java applications
 A capsule is a single executable JAR that contains everything an application
 needs to run either in the form of embedded files or as declarative metadata.
 It can contain JAR artifacts, dependencies and resources, native libraries,
 the required Java Runtime Environment version, the Java Virtual Machine flags
 required to run the application well, Java or native agents and more. In
 short, a capsule is a self-contained JAR that knows everything there is to
 know about how to run the application the way it is meant to run.
 .
 One way of thinking about a capsule is as a fat JAR on steroids (that also
 allows native libraries and never interferes with your dependencies) and a
 declarative startup script rolled into one; another, is to see it is as the
 deploy-time counterpart to your build tool. Just as a build tool manages your
 build, Capsule manages the launching of your application.
 .
 This package contains a fork of the original capsule project. This fork is
 suited as a dependency of nextflow.

 .
  * EMV cards, including NFC ones
  * Navigo public transport cards (partially supports MOBIB as well)
  * The French health card "Vitale 2"
  * Electronic/Biometric passports in BAC security mode
 .
 It can also read the following cards with limited interpretation of data:
  * Some Mifare cards (such as the Thalys card)
  * Moneo, the French electronic purse
  * GSM SIM cards
 .

Description: Rust package manager, documentation
 Cargo is a tool that allows Rust projects to declare their various
 dependencies, and ensure that you'll always get a repeatable build.
 .
 To accomplish this goal, Cargo does four things:
  * Introduces two metadata files with various bits of project information.
  * Fetches and builds your project's dependencies.
  * Invokes rustc or another build tool with the correct parameters to build
    your project.
  * Introduces conventions, making working with Rust projects easier.
 .
 Cargo downloads your Rust project’s dependencies and compiles your
 project.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.

Description: dynamic geometry software with highly ergonomic UI
 Based on the C.a.R. (Compass and Ruler) project, CaRMetal includes
 all of its functionalities - or almost. It propose a different approach
 from the graphical interface point of view.
 .
  - Ruler and compass constructions can be changed by dragging one of the
 basic construction points. The construction follows immediately. The
 student can check the correctness of the construction and gain new
 insight.
  - Tracks of points and animated constructions can help to understand
 geometric relations. Tracks can be used as new objects to explore.
  - With the macros of C.a.R. very complicated constructions become
 possible. Macros are also a way to organize the geometric thinking.
  - Hiding construction details and using colors make constructions
 clearer to read. In C.a.R. lines and circles can also be reduced to the
 relevant points.
  - Arithmetic computations, numerical solutions, curves and functions
 go beyond classical constructions. It is even possible to construct in 3D
 using advanced macros.
  - Other geometries, hyperbolic or elliptic, can be explored.
  - Scripting (javascript based) of figures.

Description: Makefile snippets for centralized configuration management and typesetting
 Caspar offers Makefile snippets for tasks like installing files you maintain
 using a version control system, or typesetting documents in some markup
 language.
 .
 If you need to maintain and distribute lots of files (system configuration
 files for Unix hosts using a version control system, e.g.), caspar is likely
 useful for you.
 It is comparable with other tools for Unix system administrators like
 puppet and cfengine.  Main difference: the caspar code consists of less than
 100 lines of GNU Make, so if puppet and cfengine are overkill for your needs,
 you'll probably like the small and simple caspar tool.
 .
 If you write documents in a markup language like LaTeX, DocBook
 XML, DocBook SGML, POD or Markdown, and want to automate the typesetting,
 you'll like caspar.  Install all suggested packages if you'd like to use this
 typesetting functionality (or pick the suitable ones from the list of
 suggested packages).
 .
 It's not strictly necessary to know how to write Makefiles when using caspar.

 than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated
 world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or,
 if you're lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of
 Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities,
 from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and
 deadlier, and against the others like yourself, that want what you have...

Description: visually comparing bacterial, plasmid, chloroplast, or mitochondrial sequences
 The CGView Comparison Tool (CCT) is a package for visually comparing
 bacterial, plasmid, chloroplast, or mitochondrial sequences of interest
 to existing genomes or sequence collections. The comparisons are
 conducted using BLAST, and the BLAST results are presented in the form
 of graphical maps that can also show sequence features, gene and protein
 names, COG category assignments, and sequence composition
 characteristics. CCT can generate maps in a variety of sizes, including
 400 Megapixel maps suitable for posters. Comparisons can be conducted
 within a particular species or genus, or all available genomes can be
 used. The entire map creation process, from downloading sequences to
 redrawing zoomed maps, can be completed easily using scripts included
 with the CCT. User-defined features or analysis results can be included
 on maps, and maps can be extensively customized. To simplify program
 setup, a CCT virtual machine that includes all dependencies preinstalled
 is available. Detailed tutorials illustrating the use of CCT are
 included with the CCT documentation.

 labels have four lines of nice curved text and an additional four
 fields with normal text. Each field has selectable text-size, font and
 colour. The background colour is also selectable. The label may also have
 a background image.
 You can squeeze the whole page if your printer doesn't generate correct
 circles and you can move the two labels on the sheet to accommodate
 different types of label sheets.
 The output is postscript to make it as portable as possible.

 Cedar Backup is focused around weekly backups to a single CD or DVD disc, with
 the expectation that the disc will be changed or overwritten at the beginning
 of each week.  If your hardware is new enough, Cedar Backup can write
 multisession discs, allowing you to add incremental data to a disc on a daily
 basis.
 .
 Alternately, Cedar Backup can write your backups to the Amazon S3 cloud
 rather than relying on physical media.
 .
 Besides offering command-line utilities to manage the backup process, Cedar
 Backup provides a well-organized library of backup-related functionality,
 written in the Python 3 programming language.
 .
 This package provides Cedar Backup command-line utilities as well as the
 CedarBackup3 Python library.  The accompanying documentation package
 (cedar-backup3-doc) contains all of the end-user and library public
 interface documentation.  You really should install cedar-backup3-doc and
 read through the end-user documentation before using Cedar Backup for the
 first time.

Description: action game similar to Super Pang
 A game similar to 'Super Pang'. You are attacked by little green balls which
 are bouncing around and which you have to destroy with your knife. Your knife
 however is limited to being thrown upwards, thus you have to get under
 the balls to destroy them. Even worse, if you destroy a large ball, it doesn't
 just vanish, but breaks apart into two smaller balls. Levels consist of little
 platforms connected by ladders, so you can go up and down or find cover
 if needed.
 .
 This package includes the data of the game.

Description: async task/job queue based on message passing (common files)
 Celery is an open source asynchronous task queue/job queue based on
 distributed message passing. It is focused on real-time operation,
 but supports scheduling as well.
 .
 The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on one
 or more worker nodes. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the
 background) or synchronously (wait until ready).
 .
 Celery is written in Python, but the protocol can be implemented
 in any language. It can also operate with other languages using
 webhooks.
 .
 The recommended message broker is RabbitMQ, but limited support for Redis,
 Beanstalk, MongoDB, CouchDB, and databases (using SQLAlchemy or the Django
 ORM) is also available. Celery is easy to integrate with Django, using the
 python-django-celery package.
 .
 This package contains the common files of the library.

 cereal provides a framework to easily set up and maintain automated,
 timestamped logs of serial lines, while simultaneously allowing end
 user access to them.  This is probably most useful for providing
 automated, logged access to remote serial consoles.
 .
 cereal can control an arbitrary number of independently monitored and
 logged lines.  Direct access to the monitored lines is allowed only
 to a specific user (who doesn't necessarily otherwise have access to
 the direct serial line), but logs can be made available to any group.
 Logs are rotated automatically and their total space can be limited
 in size.

 CeWL (Custom Word List generator) is a ruby app which spiders
 a given URL, up to a specified depth, and returns a list of
 words which can then be used for password crackers such as John
 the Ripper. Optionally, CeWL can follow  external links.
 .
 CeWL can also create a list of email addresses found in mailto
 links. These email addresses can be used as usernames in brute
 force actions.
 .
 Another tool provided by CeWL project is FAB (Files Already
 Bagged). FAB extracts the content of the author/creator fields,
 from metadata of the some files, to create lists of possible
 usernames. These usernames can be used in association with the
 password list generated by CeWL. FAB uses the same metadata
 extraction techniques that CeWL. Currently, FAB process Office
 pre 2007, Office 2007 and PDF formats.
 .
 CeWL is useful in security tests and forensics investigations.
 CeWL is pronounced "cool".

Description: control flow analyzer for C source files (documentation)
 GNU cflow analyzes a collection of source files written in C language
 and outputs a graph charting dependencies between various functions.
 .
 GNU cflow is able to produce two kinds of graphs: direct and reverse.
 Direct graph begins with the main function (or any other function),
 and displays recursively all functions called by it. In contrast,
 reverse graph is a set of subgraphs, charting for each function its
 callers, in the reverse order. Due to their tree-like appearance,
 graphs can also be called trees.
 .
 In addition to these two output modes, cflow is able to produce a
 cross-reference listing of all the symbols encountered in the input
 files.
 .
 GNU cflow also provides detailed control over symbols that will appear
 in its output, allowing to omit those that are of no interest to the
 user. The exact appearance of the output graphs is also configurable.
 .
 This package contains the HTML documentation and Info.

Description: command-line source browsing tool
 cgvg is a pair of Perl scripts ("cg" and "vg") which are meant to
 assist a programmer in doing command-line source browsing.
 .
 The idea is you can easily search for keywords in the code, and jump
 to the file and line where a match is found. Used with ctags(1), this
 can really help with jumping around and following code. Some features
 include a human-readable output, coloring, bold (and alternate
 bolding), and just sheer convenience for a programmer.
 .
 cgvg uses the Perl internal find and does its own searching, rather
 than being a wrapper for UNIX find(1) and grep(1). There is a
 ~/.cgvgrc file for per-user configuration, and some nice features
 like coloring, and multiple log files.

 circular genomes. Its primary purpose is to serve as a component of
 sequence annotation pipelines, as a means of generating visual output
 suitable for the web. Feature information and rendering options are
 supplied to the program using an XML file, a tab delimited file, or an
 NCBI ptt file. CGView converts the input into a graphical map (PNG, JPG,
 or Scalable Vector Graphics format), complete with labels, a title,
 legends, and footnotes. In addition to the default full view map, the
 program can generate a series of hyperlinked maps showing expanded
 views. The linked maps can be explored using any web browser, allowing
 rapid genome browsing, and facilitating data sharing. The feature labels
 in maps can be hyperlinked to external resources, allowing CGView maps
 to be integrated with existing web site content or databases.
 .
 In addition to the CGView application, an API is available for
 generating maps from within other Java applications, using the
 cgview package.
 .
 CGView can be used for any of the following:
  * Bacterial genome visualization and browsing - CGView can be
    incorporated into bacterial genome annotation pipelines, as a means
    of generating web content for data visualization and navigation. The
    PNG and image map content does not require Java applets or special
    browser plugins.
  * Genome poster generation - CGView can generate poster-sized images of
    circular genomes in rasterized image formats or in Scalable Vector
    Graphics format.
  * Sequence analysis visualization - CGView can be used to display the
    output of sequence analysis programs in a circular context.
 .
 CGView features:
  * Images can be generated in PNG, JPG, or SVG format. See the
    CGView gallery.
  * Static or interactive maps can be generated. The interactive maps
    make use of standard PNG images and HTML image maps. Scalable Vector
    Graphics output is included in the interactive maps (see example).
  * The XML input allows complete control over the appearance of the map.
  * Tab delimited input files and NCBI ptt files can be used as an
    alternative to the XML format.
  * The CGView API can be used to incorporate CGView into Java
    applications.
  * The CGView applet can be used to incorporate zoomable maps into web
    pages (see example).
  * The CGView Server can be used to generate maps online.

Description: create and visualize 3-dimensional drawings of simple molecules
 This program provides a web interface which has been developed to
 allow users to create and visualize 3-dimensional drawings of simple
 molecules without requiring the download of any additional
 software. In addition to creating structures, users can also load
 existing XYZ formatted files (such as those generated by Open Babel)
 containing 3-dimensional coordinates.
 .
 Once molecules are created or read from a file, users can examine
 geometry information (bond lengths, angles, and dihedral angles) and
 modify these structures. Routines to perform a crude geometry
 optimization and a simple calculation of atomic charges are also
 available.
 .
 This web interface relies on HTML5 (in particular, the HTML5 Canvas),
 and as such requires a modern web browser to run. The advantage of
 this approach is the no additional plugins or Java is required to use
 this program. Support for mobile devices is currently only partially
 implemented, but is planned to be included in future versions.

Description: Default credential scanner
 This package contains a default credential scanner. Commercial vulnerability
 scanners miss common default credentials. Getting default credentials added to
 commercial scanners is often difficult and slow. changeme is designed to be
 simple to add new credentials without having to write any code or modules.
 .
 changeme keeps credential data separate from code. All credentials are stored
 in yaml files so they can be both easily read by humans and processed by
 changeme. Credential files can be created by using the ./changeme.py --mkcred
 tool and answering a few questions.
 .
 changeme supports the http/https, MSSQL, MySQL, Postgres, ssh and ssh w/key
 protocols. Use ./changeme.py --dump to output all of the currently available
 credentials.

Description: trace network sessions and export it to html format
 Chaosreader traces TCP/UDP/others sessions and fetches application data from
 snoop or tcpdump logs (or other libpcap compatible programs). This is a type
 of "any-snarf" program, as it will fetch telnet sessions, FTP files, HTTP
 transfers (HTML, GIF, JPEG etc) and SMTP emails from the captured data inside
 network traffic logs. A html index file is created to that links to all the
 session details, including realtime replay programs for telnet, rlogin, IRC,
 X11 and VNC sessions. Chaosreader reports such as image reports and HTTP
 GET/POST content reports.
 .
 It also creates replay programs for telnet sessions, so that you can play
 them back in realtime (or even different speeds).
 .
 Chaosreader can also run in standalone mode, where it invokes tcpdump or
 snoop (a similar to tcpdump program for Solaris) to create the log files
 and then processes them.
 .
 This package is useful for forensics investigations and for network traffic
 analysis.

 .
 This program was originally called vrms but as the opinions of Richard M.
 Stallman and the Debian project have diverged since the program was written
 it has been renamed to check-dfsg-status. This is also a more accurate name
 as the program always followed the Debian Free Software Guidelines.

Description: PostgreSQL plugin for Nagios
 check_pgactivity is a Nagios probe dedicated to PostgreSQL. It offers many
 options to measure and monitor useful performance metrics.
 .
 Services include (among others) monitoring of autovacuum, bgwriter, locks,
 long queries, idle in transaction queries, number of temporary files and WAL
 files, bloat of tables and btree indexes, commit and hit ratios,
 WAL archives exhaustivity, age of logical backups, backends number and states,
 backup label file age, connectivity, replication delay between primary and
 secondary instances, database sizes, vacuum and analyze times,
 sequence exhaustion, snapshots age, presence of unlogged tables or invalid
 indexes, incoming freeze, settings changes, PostgreSQL minor version,
 PGDATA rights, custom queries. Most services only need normal user rights.

 Modern Linux distributions offer some mitigation techniques to make it harder
 to exploit software vulnerabilities reliably. Mitigations such as RELRO,
 NoExecute (NX), Stack Canaries, Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and
 Position Independent Executables (PIE) have made reliably exploiting any
 vulnerabilities that do exist far more challenging. The checksec.sh script is
 designed to test what standard Linux OS and PaX security features are being
 used.

Description: basic system security checks
 Checksecurity can periodically do some very basic system security checks:
 .
    * check-setuid  - scans for insecurely mounted remote file systems,
      and tracks changes in setuid programs;
    * check-sockets - tracks changes in open ports to detect rogue programs;
    * check-passwd  - scans for empty or duplicate system accounts;
    * check-disfree - scans for mounted filesystems nearing capacity;
    * check-iptables-logs -  scans logs generated by iptables and look
      for intrusion attempts.
 .
 Be aware that these minimal set of checks are no substitute for a full
 security auditing and integrity checking system.
 .
 In addition to these checks you are encourage to install additional packages
 (listed in "Recommends") to provide more information concerning the security
 or vulnerability of your system.
 .
 Installing the suggested package lockfile-progs can help to prevent
 the cron jobs running multiple times if something gets jammed.

Description: Documentation of the libchemps2-3 package
 chemps2 is a scientific library which contains a spin-adapted
 implementation of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
 for ab initio quantum chemistry. This wavefunction method allows one
 to obtain numerical accuracy in active spaces beyond the capabilities
 of full configuration interaction (FCI), and allows one to extract
 the 2-, 3-, and 4-particle reduced density matrices (2-, 3- and 4-RDM)
 of the active space.
 .
 For general active spaces up to 40 electrons in 40 orbitals can be
 handled with DMRG, and for one-dimensional active spaces up to 100
 electrons in 100 orbitals. The 2-RDM of these active spaces can
 also be easily extracted, while the 3- and 4-RDM are limited to
 about 28 orbitals.
 .
 When the active space size becomes prohibitively expensive for FCI,
 DMRG can be used to replace the FCI solver in the complete active
 space self consistent field (CASSCF) method and the corresponding
 complete active space second order perturbation theory (CASPT2).
 The corresponding methods are called DMRG-SCF and DMRG-CASPT2,
 respectively. For DMRG-SCF the active space 2-RDM is required, and
 for DMRG-CASPT2 the active space 4-RDM.
 .
 This is the common documentation package.

Description: tools performing common ChIP-Seq data analysis tasks (data)
 The ChIP-Seq software provides a set of tools performing common genome-
 wide ChIP- seq analysis tasks, including positional correlation
 analysis, peak detection, and genome partitioning into signal-rich and
 signal-poor regions. These tools exist as stand-alone C programs and
 perform the following tasks:
 .
  1. Positional correlation analysis and generation of an aggregation
     plot (AP) (chipcor),
  2. Extraction of specific genome annotation features around reference
     anchor points (chipextract),
  3. Read centering or shifting (chipcenter),
  4. Narrow peak caller using a fixed width peak size (chippeak),
  5. Broad peak caller used for large regions of enrichment (chippart),
  6. Feature selection tool based on a read count threshold (chipscore).
 .
 Because the ChIP-Seq tools are primarily optimized for speed, they use
 their own compact format for ChIP-seq data representation called SGA
 (Simplified Genome Annotation). SGA is a line-oriented, tab-delimited
 plain text format.
 .

Description: detection of malicious changes for boot files
 chkboot is a set of scripts that will display a notification (console or
 graphical) when boot files are tempered with.
 .
 This tool is indented to be used on encrypted disks. In order to get the
 operating system to run, parts of the boot process must remains un-encrypted.
 chkboot checks that those files have not changed between reboots.
 .
 Since the scripts and the data they generate are stored on the encrypted part
 of the disk, any attempts to modify the boot partition between reboots will be
 detected.
 .
 Please note that this tool is not effective against rootkit that hides every
 boot files modifications or prevents chkboot from functioning properly.

Description: Chromatin state discovery and characterization
 ChromHMM is software for learning and characterizing chromatin states.
 ChromHMM can integrate multiple chromatin datasets such as ChIP-seq data of
 various histone modifications to discover de novo the major re-occuring
 combinatorial and spatial patterns of marks. ChromHMM is based on a
 multivariate Hidden Markov Model that explicitly models the presence or
 absence of each chromatin mark. The resulting model can then be used to
 systematically annotate a genome in one or more cell types. By automatically
 computing state enrichments for large-scale functional and annotation datasets
 ChromHMM facilitates the biological characterization of each state. ChromHMM
 also produces files with genome-wide maps of chromatin state annotations that
 can be directly visualized in a genome browser.

Description: Large-scale systematic epigenome imputation
 ChromImpute takes an existing compendium of epigenomic data and uses it to
 predict signal tracks for mark-sample combinations not experimentally mapped
 or to generate a potentially more robust version of data sets that have been
 mapped experimentally. ChromImpute bases its predictions on features from
 signal tracks of other marks that have been mapped in the target sample and
 the target mark in other samples with these features combined using an
 ensemble of regression trees.

Description: IMAP webmail service
 CiderWebmail is a modern, user friendly and maintenance free webmail
 application. It's targeted at mailserver administrators who need to
 provide web access for their user's mailboxes and individuals wanting
 to access their mailboxes via an always available web application.
 .
 It currently supports all the basic mail handling features one would
 expect from such an application:
 .
  * Listing your emails with selectable sort order and grouping.
  * Moving emails between folders and deleting using drag & drop.
  * Displaying text and HTML emails even if their code is completely
    broken (which happens quite often in reality)
  * Keyboard bindings for switching through emails, moving, deleting,
    replying and forwarding.
  * Reply to and forward existing emails or write new emails, add
    attachments and have a copy saved in your "Sent" folder.
 .
 As an application written deep in the 21st century, CiderWebmail
 supports only IMAP mail servers.
 .
 It is recommended to use CiderWebmail with the Dovecot IMAP server.
 CiderWebmail deliberately does little internal caching for security
 reasons, so if used with an IMAP server less powerful than Dovecot you
 may benefit from connecting via imapproxy.

 Images are instantiated by a class able to represent images up to 4-dimension
 wide (from 1-D scalar signals to 3-D volumes of vector-valued pixels), with
 template pixel types. It depends on a minimal number of libraries : you can
 compile it with only standard C libraries. No need for exotic libraries and
 complex dependencies.
 .
 This package contains examples for the usage of the library.

Description: Allows for ASDF system to be connected so that auto-loading may occur
 ASDF-System-Connections provides auto-loading of systems that only make
 sense when several other systems are loaded. If I'm lucky, an example will
 make this clear! CL-Containers and CL-Variates are separate systems and can
 therefore be loaded independently. If both of them are loaded, however,
 then it makes sense to also load code that uses CL-Variates to sample
 random elements from containers. Rather than requiring you to remember to
 load that extra system (and to load it only after both Cl-Containers and
 CL-Variates are loaded), ASDF-System-Connections lets you set things up so
 that loading happens automatically.

Description: charset encoding/decoding library for Common Lisp
 Babel is a charset encoding/decoding library, not unlike GNU libiconv, but
 completely written in Common Lisp.
 .
 It strives to achieve decent performance. To that effect, it uses OpenMCL's
 approach of calculating the destination buffer size in advance. Most of the
 encoding/decoding algorithms have been adapted from OpenMCL's source.
 .
 Another important goal is reusability. Similarly to SBCL, it defines an
 interface wherein the algorithms can be reused between a variety of data types
 so long we're dealing with conversions between octets and unicode code points.
 .
 Babel comes with converters between strings and (unsigned-byte 8) vectors but
 can be easily extended to deal with, e.g., strings and foreign memory, vectors
 and Closure's runes, etc...

Description: Common Foreign Function Interface for Common Lisp
 CFFI, the Common Foreign Function Interface, purports to be a portable foreign
 function interface for Common Lisp. The CFFI library is composed of a
 Lisp-implementation-specific backend in the CFFI-SYS package, and a portable
 frontend in the CFFI package.
 .
 The CFFI-SYS backend package defines a low-level interface to the native FFI
 support in the Lisp implementation. It offers operators for allocating and
 dereferencing foreign memory, calling foreign functions, and loading shared
 libraries. The CFFI frontend provides a declarative interface for defining
 foreign functions, structures, typedefs, enumerated types. It is implemented
 in portable ANSI CL making use of the low-level operators exported by
 CFFI-SYS.
 .
 A UFFI compatibility layer is also being developed.

Description: Portable chunked streams for Common Lisp
 Chunga implements streams capable of chunked encoding on demand as defined
 in RFC 2616. For an example of how these streams can be used see cl-drakma.
 .
 The library needs a Common Lisp implementation that supports Gray streams
 and relies on David Lichteblau's trivial-gray-streams to offer portability
 between different Lisps.
 .
 Chunga is currently not optimized towards performance - it is rather
 intended to be easy to use and (if possible) to behave correctly.

Description: Cross Implementation AMOP library
 This library enhances the different MOP implementations so that
 they support better the AMOP specifications.
 .
 The CLOS spec contained two parts, only the basic level went into
 the Common Lisp standard. The lower level functions of the AMOP
 were not included so different implementations differ (mostly
 slightly) in how to implement the AMOP.
 .
 With the help of cl-closer-mop you can use the full power of
 AMOP on all supported implementations, relying on the library
 to translate your code.
 .
 Supported implementations:
  - Allegro Common Lisp
  - Armed Bear Common Lisp (ABCL)
  - Clisp
  - Clozure Common Lisp (CCL)
  - CMU Common Lisp (CMUCL)
  - Embeddable Common Lisp (ECL)
  - LispWorks Personal and Hobbyist editions
  - Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL)

Description: Lisp declarative configuration management system
 Consfigurator is a system for declarative configuration management using
 Common Lisp.  You can use it to configure hosts as root, deploy services as
 unprivileged users, build and deploy containers, install operating systems,
 produce disc images, and more.  Some key advantages:
 .
  * Apply configuration by transparently starting up another Lisp image on the
    machine to be configured, so that you can use the full power of Common Lisp
    to inspect and control the host.
 .
  * Also define properties of hosts in a more restricted language, that of
    :POSIX properties, to configure machines, containers and user accounts
    where you can't install Lisp.  These properties can be applied using just
    an SSH or serial connection, but they can also be applied by remote Lisp
    images, enabling code reuse.
 .
  * Flexibly chain and nest methods of connecting to hosts.  For example, you
    could have Consfigurator SSH to a host, sudo to root, start up Lisp, use
    the setns(2) system call to enter a Linux container, and then deploy a
    service.  Secrets, and other prerequisite data, are properly passed along.
 .
  * Combine declarative semantics for defining hosts and services with a
    multiparadigmatic general-purpose programming language that won't get in
    your way.
 .
 Declarative configuration management systems like Consfigurator and Propellor
 share a number of goals with projects like the GNU Guix System and NixOS.
 However, tools like Consfigurator and Propellor try to layer the power of
 declarative and reproducible configuration semantics on top of traditional,
 battle-tested UNIX system administration infrastructure like distro package
 managers, package archives and daemon configuration mechanisms, rather than
 seeking to replace any of those.  Let's get as much as we can out of all that
 existing distro policy-compliant work!

Description: Common Lisp containers data structures
 Common Lisp ships with a set of powerful built in data structures including
 the venerable list, full featured arrays, and hash-tables. CL-containers
 enhances and builds on these structures in two ways:
 .
 By adding containers that are not available in native Lisp (for example:
 binary search trees, red-black trees, sparse arrays and so on).
 .
 By providing a standard interface so that they are simpler to use and so
 that changing design decisions becomes significantly easier.

 ContextL provides the Common Lisp Object System with functionality
 for context orientation. It allows the definition of context-specific
 methods or class slots, so that methods act differently depending on

 .
 It further allows developers to rebind places (e.g. slots of objects)
 dynamically using the "dletf" framework that has previously been
 present in AspectL.

Description: Flexi-streams: Flexible bivalent streams for Common Lisp
 FLEXI-STREAMS implements "virtual" bivalent streams that can be layered
 atop real binary or bivalent streams and that can be used to read and
 write character data in various single- or multi-octet encodings which
 can be changed on the fly. It also supplies in-memory binary streams
 which are similar to string streams.
 .
 FLEXI-STREAMS is currently not optimized towards performance - it is
 rather intended to be easy to use and (if possible) to behave correctly.

MD5sum: e4f6e26230081ae819f18071d31565bf
Description: efficient global variables in Common Lisp
 In Common Lisp, a special variable that is never dynamically bound typically
 serves as a stand-in for a global variable. This library provides true global
 variables that are implemented by some compilers. An attempt to rebind a
 global variable properly results in a compiler error. That is, a global
 variable cannot be dynamically bound.
 .
 Global variables therefore allow one to communicate an intended usage that
 differs from special variables. Global variables are also more efficient than
 special variables, especially in the presence of threads.

 cryptography algorithms. For several implementations that support Gray
 Streams, support is included for convenient stream wrappers.
 .
 Most of the algorithms were written with efficiency for specific
 Common Lisp implementations in mind, although portable code is
 provided as an alternative in nearly all instances. The framework
 should be flexible enough to accommodate implementation-specific
 optimizations when possible.
 .
 Test vectors for many of the algorithms are included to provide
 a level of confidence in the correctness of the implementations.

Description: uniform frontend to running Common Lisp code from the shell
 CL-Launch will allow you to invoke Common Lisp source code from the shell
 command line, from a shell script or as a Common Lisp script. It will also
 allow you to turn your Common Lisp source programs into standalone
 executables or executable shell scripts (optionally using a dumped image),
 depending on the features available in your underlying implementation.
 .
 CL-Launch will automatically detect a supported Common Lisp implementation
 and use adequate invocation options. It can also be configured to fit exactly
 the programmer's desires. Fully supported implementations are:
        Allegro, CLISP, ClozureCL, CMUCL, ECL, MKCL, SBCL, SCL.
 Partially supported implementations are:
        LispWorks Professional, ABCL, GCL, XCL.
 Creating standalone executables is supported on:
        CLISP, ClozureCL, CMUCL, LispWorks, SBCL, SCL
 .
 CL-Launch also offers Common Lisp programs a simple uniform interface to
 invocation parameters (command-line arguments and environment variables).
 It relies on ASDF 3 for system construction. See the ASDF 3 manual for
 more information on how to configure source and object code location.
 CL-Launch may dump memory images for fast startup (at the expense of disk
 space). It can also be used as a quick way to evaluate and print simple Lisp
 forms or scripts from the command-line without invoking a full-fledged REPL,
 and to easily compare results between implementations.

Description: Common Lisp library that creates namespaces for named readtables
 Named-Readtables is a library that provides a namespace for readtables akin to
 the already-existing namespace of packages in Common Lisp. In particular:
 .
  - you can associate readtables with names, and retrieve readtables by names;
 .
  - you can associate source files with readtable names, and be sure that the
    right readtable is active when compiling/loading the file;
 .
  - similarly, your development environment now has a chance to automatically
    determine what readtable should be active while processing source forms on
    interactive commands. (E.g. think of `C-c C-c` in Slime (yet to be done))
 .
 It follows that Named-Readtables is a facility for using readtables in
 a localized way.
 .
 Additionally, it also attempts to become a facility for using
 readtables in a modular way. In particular:
 .
  - it provides a macro to specify the content of a readtable at a glance;
 .
  - it makes it possible to use multiple inheritance between readtables.

 Features efficient communication with the database server without need for

 a syntax for mixing SQL and Lisp code, convenient support for prepared
 statements and stored procedures, a metaclass for simple database-access
 objects
 .
 The biggest differences between this library and CLSQL/CommonSQL are that
 Postmodern has no intention of being portable across different SQL
 implementations (it embraces non-standard Postgres features), and
 approaches extensions like lispy SQL and database access objects in a quite
 different way. This library was written because the CLSQL approach did not
 really work for me, your mileage may vary.

Description: Common Lisp types for dates, timestamps, and intervals
 Simple-date provides types (CLOS classes) for dates, timestamps, and
 intervals similar to the ones SQL databases use, in order to be able to
 store and read these to and from a database in a straightforward way. A few
 obvious operations are defined on these types.
 .
 The most glaring defect of this library is its ignorance of time zones. It
 pretends the whole world lives in UTC. Use with care.
 .
 When this library is loaded after CL-postgres, it will register suitable SQL
 readers and writers for the associated database types.

Description: generate a Common Lisp backtrace portably
 One of the many things that didn't quite get into the Common Lisp standard
 was how to get a Lisp to output its call stack when something has gone
 wrong. As such, each Lisp has developed its own notion of what to display,
 how to display it, and what sort of arguments can be used to customize it.
 trivial-backtrace is a simple solution to generating a backtrace portably.
 .
 It supports Allegro Common Lisp, LispWorks, ECL, MCL, SCL, SBCL and CMUCL.

Description: small Common Lisp library for doing UTF-8-based in- and output
 Trivial UTF-8 is a small library for doing UTF-8-based in- and output on a
 Lisp implementation that already supports Unicode -- meaning char-code and
 code-char deal with Unicode character codes.
 .
 The rationale for the existence of this library is that while
 Unicode-enabled implementations usually do provide some kind of interface
 to dealing with character encodings, these are typically not terribly
 flexible or uniform.
 .
 The Babel library solves a similar problem while understanding more
 encodings. Trivial UTF-8 was written before Babel existed, but for new
 projects you might be better off going with Babel. The one plus that
 Trivial UTF-8 has is that it doesn't depend on any other libraries.

 they aren't conveniently packaged and maintained. It takes quite a bit
 of work to carefully implement utilities for common use, commented

Description: anti-virus utility for Unix - test files
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of
 this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
 scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable
 multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
 scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
 the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based
 on libclamav, which can be used by other software.
 .
 This package contains files 'infected' with a test signature. The test
 signature (ClamAV-Test-Signature) should be detectable by all
 anti-virus programs.

Description: Reference documentation and tutorials for ClanLib
 ClanLib delivers a platform independent interface to write games with.
 If a game is written with ClanLib, it should be possible to compile the
 game under any platform (supported by ClanLib, that is) without changing
 the application source code.
 .
 But ClanLib is not just a wrapper library, providing a common interface
 to low-level libraries such as DirectFB, DirectX, OpenGL, X11, etc. While
 platform independence is ClanLib's primary goal, it also tries to be a
 service-minded game SDK. In other words, great effort has been put into
 designing the API, to ensure ClanLib's ease of use - while maintaining its
 power.
 .
 This package contains html documentation for the ClanLib API and some
 tutorials to ease the learning curve for programming with it.

Description: A(nother) Common Lisp FullScreen Window Manager
 CLFSWM is a 100% Common Lisp X11 window manager (based on Tinywm and
 Stumpwm. Many thanks to them).  It can be driven only with the
 keyboard or with the mouse.
 .
 A display contains a root frame and its children. A child can be a
 window or another frame. The root frame or its children can be the
 current root. The current root is fullscreen maximized (no
 decorations, no buttons, no menus: nothing, just the application
 fullscreen!).
 .
 CLFSWM is highly dynamic. By default there is only one frame (the root
 frame). Other frames are created/deleted on the fly. A window can be
 in more than one frame, so it can have multiple views of the same
 windows.
 .
 Using CLFSWM is like walking through a tree of frames and
 windows. Enter in a child to make it the current root and make it
 fullscreen maximized. Leave it to make its parent the current root.

 It's the same concept as in Python's doctest module: you document
 both the commands and their expected output, using the familiar
 interactive prompt format, and a specialized tool tests them.
 .
 The clitest command searches for pieces of text that look like
 interactive Unix command lines, and then executes those command
 lines to verify that they work exactly as shown.

Description: Lisp dialect for the JVM
 Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual
 Machine. It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the
 approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with
 an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming.
 Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode,
 yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is
 supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java
 frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that
 calls to Java can avoid reflection.
 .
 Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data
 philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a
 functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable,
 persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers
 a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that
 ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.

Description: bare metal backup and recovery of disk drives
 Clonezilla is an OpenSource clone system (OCS) solution with
 unicasting and multicasting.
 .
 Clonezilla, based on drbl, partclone and udpcast, allows you to do
 bare metal backup and recovery. This package provides Clonezilla SE
 (server edition) which is for massive deployment: it can clone many
 (40 plus!) computers simultaneously.
 .
 Clonezilla saves and restores only used blocks in the harddisk. This
 increases the clone efficiency. At the NCHC's Classroom C, Clonezilla
 SE was used to clone 41 computers simultaneously. It took only about
 10 minutes to clone a 5.6 GBytes system image to all 41 computers via
 multicasting.

Description: boot off a rescue volume rather than root filesystem
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed the initramfs will check to see if any partitions
 with a label of 'RESCUE_VOL' are attached.  If such a volume is attached,
 it will boot off that volume rather than the root volume.
 .
 This is useful in a cloud environment, when the user is able to
 attach and detach volumes to a running system, but has no other
 mechanism for interrupting of fixing a failed boot.  It is analogous
 to inserting a rescue CD into a system to recover from failure.

 cme and Config::Model are quite modular: the configuration data that
 you can edit depend on installed packages. I.e.:
  - ssh client or ssh daemon config: libconfig-model-openssh-perl
  - approx config: libconfig-model-approx-perl
  - lcdproc config: libconfig-model-lcdproc-perl
  - popcon config: provided with libconfig-model-perl
  - systemd config: provided with libconfig-model-systemd-perl
 .
 Some applications can be handled by cme:
  - Debian package files: libconfig-model-dpkg-perl
  - multistrap files: provided with libconfig-model-perl
 .
 You can also choose a user interface:
  - graphical, based on Tk: libconfig-model-tkui-perl
  - curses based: libconfig-model-cursesui-perl
  - simple shell: provided with libconfig-model-perl
 .
 Last but not least, you can also take a stab at maintaining
 configuration model with libconfig-model-itself-perl.

Description: Nonlinear equations and nonlinear least squares problems (doc)
 Minpack includes software for solving nonlinear equations and nonlinear least
 squares problems. Five algorithmic paths each include a core subroutine and an
 easy-to-use driver. The algorithms proceed either from an analytic
 specification of the Jacobian matrix or directly from the problem functions.
 The paths include facilities for systems of equations with a banded Jacobian
 matrix, for least squares problems with a large amount of data, and for
 checking the consistency of the Jacobian matrix with the functions.
 .
 This is the C re-write of the original fortran minpack implementation.
 .
 This package contains documentation files for cminpack.

  * Easy to use framework to write unit tests
  * Support for mock objects
  * Testing of memory leaks, buffer overflows and underflows
  * Platform and compiler independent

Description: CMUCL lisp sources
 These are the CMUCL sources, provided so that the
 debugger can show useful source information at appropriate
 times.
 .
 This version includes common-lisp-controller compatible
 replacements for defsystem, graystream, clx and hemlock.
 .
 defsystem provides a "make" type system for Lisp. This is
 a patched version from clocc.
 .
 Gray streams are the usual Lisp streams, but re-implemented
 as a Object hierarchy. Users can subclass existing classes and
 adapt them for their own needs.
 .
 cmucl-clx is the clx library adapted for CMUCL. clx is an
 interface to X11, just like xlib.
 .
 Hemlock is an emacs clone for CMUCL.
 .
 Note that this version only works in X, the tty interface
 is broken: the system can't parse /etc/termcap.
 .
 To open the editor, type "(ed)".
 .
 Note that to recompile CMUCL you need a working CMUCL system :-(

 Coco/R is a compiler generator, which takes an attributed grammar of a source
 language and generates a scanner and a parser for this language. The scanner
 works as a deterministic finite automaton. The parser uses recursive descent.
 LL(1) conflicts can be resolved by a multi-symbol lookahead or by semantic
 checks. Thus the class of accepted grammars is LL(k) for an arbitrary k.

Description: General purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software - data
 The basic capabilities of Code_Saturne enable the handling of either
 incompressible or expandable flows with or without heat transfer and
 turbulence. Dedicated modules are available for specific physics such
 as radiative heat transfer, combustion (gas, coal, heavy fuel oil, ...),
 magneto-hydrodynamics, compressible flows, two-phase flows
 (Euler-Lagrange approach with two-way coupling), extensions to
 specific applications (e.g. Mercure_Saturne for atmospheric
 environment).
 .
 It runs in parallel with MPI on distributed memory machines.
 Developed since 1997 at EDF R&D, it is based on a co-located Finite
 Volume approach that accepts meshes with any type of cell
 (tetrahedral, hexahedral, prismatic, pyramidal, polyhedral...) and any
 type of grid structure (unstructured, block structured, hybrid,
 conforming or with hanging nodes, ...).

 CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
 Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons, JavaScript
 has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart. CoffeeScript is an
 attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.
 .
 The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: "It's just JavaScript". The code
 compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no
 interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library
 seamlessly (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable and
 pretty-printed, passes through JavaScript Lint without warnings, will
 work in every JavaScript implementation, and tends to run as fast or
 faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.
 .
 The "cake" executable is provided as "cake.coffeescript" to peacefully
 coexist with cakephp.

Description: Utility to collect Linux performance data
 Collectl is a performance monitoring and benchmark tool that tries to do it
 all.  You can choose to monitor any of a broad set of subsystems which
 currently include buddyinfo, cpu, disk, inodes, infiniband, lustre, memory,
 network, nfs, processes, quadrics, slabs, sockets and tcp.
 .
 Output can also be saved in a rolling set of logs for later playback or
 displayed interactively in a variety of formats. If all that isn't enough
 there are additional mechanisms for supplying data to external tools by
 generating output as s-expressions, a format of choice for some tools such as
 supermon or in another format called list-expressions. This output can be
 written to a file or sent over a socket. You can even create files in
 space-separated format for plotting with external packages like gnuplot.

Description: invoke your editor, with optional file:lineno handling
 All or almost all Unix editors support the syntax of "editor +42 file", to
 open the given file and start with the cursor at line 42.  Alas, the syntax
 programs that output such data use is different: either "file:42: Something"
 or "file:42:1: Something", :1 being a column number.
 .
 This wrapper will recognize such references and call your $EDITOR using the
 + notation.  Thus, once you see an error message, you can copy&paste the
 first word of it without having to manually adjust.  Especially if your
 mouse selection is configured to allow ':', it's a single triple-click
 (L+L+M), and still pretty handy if not.
 .
 If your editor allows multi-open, "e" can also handle pipelines such as:
 * git grep MEOW|e -:
 * make 2>&1 >/dev/null|grep error:|e -::
 .
 Also, because of its short name, it reduces the typing needed to start the
 editor by half if you use vi, by 80% if emacs or jstar -- and that's by far
 the most frequent command an Unix user does.

Description: Eclipse Compiler for Java (command line tool)
 Eclipse JDT Core is the Java infrastructure of the Eclipse Java IDE.
 It includes:
  * An incremental Java compiler. Implemented as an Eclipse builder, it is based
    on technology evolved from VisualAge for Java compiler. In particular, it
    allows one to run and debug code which still contains unresolved errors.
  * A Java Model that provides API for navigating the Java element tree.
    The Java element tree defines a Java centric view of a project. It surfaces
    elements like package fragments, compilation units, binary classes, types,
    methods, fields.
  * A Java Document Model providing API for manipulating a structured Java
    source document.
  * Code assist and code select support.
  * An indexed based search infrastructure that is used for searching, code
    assist, type hierarchy computation, and refactoring. The Java search engine
    can accurately find precise matches either in sources or binaries.
  * Evaluation support either in a scrapbook page or a debugger context.
  * Source code formatter

Description: Bookkeeping software for small and medium-size businesses
 EekBoek is a bookkeeping package for Dutch users; it creates reports such as
 a balance sheet ("Balans"), a general journal ("Journaal"), a general
 ledger ("Grootboek") and a VAT report ("BTW-aangifte").
 .
 Unlike other accounting software, EekBoek has a command-line interface: The
 EekBoek Shell (with tab completion).  It uses a database as back end: either
 PostgreSQL (using the eekboek-db-postgresql package) or SQLite.
 Interoperability is a key feature of EekBoek: editable text dumps of all your
 data are possible at any time.  EekBoek can generate an "XML Auditfile
 Financieel" (XAF) as used by Dutch tax office.  Furthermore, it has a
 complete Perl API to create your own custom applications.
 .
 The EekBoek documentation is available in Dutch only.
 .
 If you'd like to use EekBoek with a PostgreSQL back end (instead of the
 default SQLite), install the package eekboek-db-postgresql.
 If you'd like to use the Eekboek GUI, install the suggested package
 eekboek-gui.

Description: easy and flexible alerting with Elasticsearch
 This package contains a simple framework for alerting on anomalies, spikes, or
 other patterns of interest from data in Elasticsearch.
 .
 ElastAlert works with all versions of Elasticsearch.
 .
 If you have data being written into Elasticsearch in near real time and want to
 be alerted when that data matches certain patterns, ElastAlert is the tool for
 you.
 .
 ElastAlert is designed to be reliable, highly modular, and easy to set up and
 configure.
 .
 It works by combining Elasticsearch with two types of components, rule types
 and alerts.  Elasticsearch is periodically queried and the data is passed to
 the rule type, which determines when a match is found. When a match occurs, it
 is given to one or more alerts, which take action based on the match.
 .
 This is configured by a set of rules, each of which defines a query, a rule
 type, and a set of alerts.  .

Description: Easy to use Bitcoin client
 This package provides a lightweight Bitcoin client which protects
 you from losing your bitcoins in a backup mistake or computer
 failure. Also, Electrum does not require waiting time because it does
 not download the Bitcoin blockchain.
 .
 Features of Electrum:
 .
   * Instant on: Your client does not download the blockchain. It uses a
     network of specialized servers that index the blockchain.
   * Forgiving: Your wallet can be recovered from a secret seed.
   * Safe: Your seed and private keys are encrypted on your hard drive.
     They are never sent to the servers.
   * Low trust: Information received from the servers is verified using
     SPV. Servers are authenticated using SSL.
   * No downtimes: Your client is not tied to a particular server; it
     will switch instantly if your server is down.
   * Ubiquitous: You can use the same wallet on different computers, they
     will synchronize automatically.
   * Cold Storage: Sign transactions from a computer that is always
     offline. Broadcast them using a machine that does not have your keys.
   * Reachable: You can export your private keys into other Bitcoin
     clients.
   * Established: Electrum is open source and was first released in
     November 2011.

 elementary-xfce is a fork of the elementary OS icon theme for Xfce and other

 .
 This fork took place because the elementary OS maintainers wanted to focus
 exclusively on their desktop environment and thus dropped a lot of icon
 symlinks used by other desktops. elementary-xfce intends to keep these as-is,
 while still pulling in new icons and integrating them occasionally.

Description: functions for dealing with associative structures
 Library for dealing with associative data structures: alists,
 hash-maps, and vectors (for vectors, the indices are treated as
 keys).
 .
 This library is largely inspired by Clojure, it has many of the
 functions found in clojure.core, prefixed with `a-'. All functions
 treat their arguments as immutable, so e.g. `a-assoc' will clone the
 hash-table or alist it is given. Keep this in mind when writing
 performance sensitive code.

Description: dependently typed functional programming language — emacs mode
 Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language: It has inductive
 families, which are like Haskell's GADTs, but they can be indexed by values and
 not just types. It also has parameterised modules, mixfix operators, Unicode
 characters, and an interactive Emacs interface (the type checker can assist in
 the development of your code).
 .
 Agda is also a proof assistant: It is an interactive system for writing and
 checking proofs. Agda is based on intuitionistic type theory, a foundational
 system for constructive mathematics developed by the Swedish logician Per
 Martin-Löf. It has many similarities with other proof assistants based on
 dependent types, such as Coq, Epigram and NuPRL.
 .
 This package contains the emacs interactive development mode for Agda. This
 mode is the preferred way to write Agda code, and offers features such as
 iterative development, refinement, case analysis and so on.

Description: Emacs minor mode that reindents code after every change
 electric-indent-mode is enough to keep your code nicely aligned when
 all you do is type. However, once you start shifting blocks around,
 transposing lines, or slurping and barfing sexps, indentation is
 bound to go wrong.
 .
 aggressive-indent-mode is a minor mode that keeps your code always
 indented. It reindents after every change, making it more reliable
 than electric-indent-mode.

Description: test support functions for Emacs
 This package provides functions to support ert, the Emacs Regression
 Test framework. It includes:
 .
  * a set of predicates for comparing strings, buffers and file contents;
  * explainer functions for all predicates giving useful output;
  * macros for creating many temporary buffers at once, and for restoring
    the buffer list;
  * methods for testing indentation, by comparison or "round-tripping";
  * methods for testing fontification;
 .
 Assess aims to be a stateless as possible, leaving Emacs unchanged
 whether the tests succeed or fail, with respect to buffers, open
 files and so on; this helps to keep tests independent from each
 other. Violations of this will be considered a bug.
 .
 Assess aims also to be as noiseless as possible, reducing and
 suppressing extraneous messages where possible, to leave a clean ert
 output in batch mode.

Description: edit a web-browser text entry area with Emacs
 Atomic Chrome is an extension for the Chromium and Google Chrome
 browsers that allows one to edit text entry areas of a web-page in
 Emacs.  Atomic Chrome for Emacs also supports the use of GhostText
 Chromium and Chrome extension.
 .
 This package is similar to "Edit with Emacs"; however, it features
 two advantages over this alternative as a result of its websocket
 design:
   * Live update: The text entry area for which Atomic Chrome has been
     activated and its associated Emacs buffer are synchronised.
     Updates to one continuously propagate to the other.
   * Bidirectional communication: Edit text in either the browser
     or Emacs and difference is applied to the other half.
 .
 Firefox is also supported via the GhostText browser addon.

Description: automatic dictionary switcher for Emacs spell checking
 Auto-dictionary is a minor mode that hooks into Flyspell's on-the-fly spell
 checking and extends these checks to also detect language.  Auto-dictionary
 then sets 'ispell-dictionary' to use the detected language.  This package is
 useful for bilingual and multilingual Emacs users.
 .
 Language detection is per buffer (per document), and auto-dictionary will
 choose the language whose words appear most frequently in a document.  If that
 document also contains a second language, and then the document is edited until
 there are a greater number of words from the second language, then
 auto-dictionary will choose the second language.  That is to say,
 auto-dictionary's pick always depends on the current state of the document, and
 it will only pick one language.  This package does not enable multiple
 dictionary support for Emacs ispell.
 .
 Auto-dictionary supports the following languages:
   * ca  - Catalan
   * da  - Dansk (Danish)
   * de  - Deutsch (German)
   * el  - νέα ελληνικά (Modern Greek)
   * en  - English
   * eo  - Esperanto
   * es  - Español (Spanish)
   * fr  - Français (French)
   * grc - ἑλληνικά (Classical Greek)
   * hi  - हिन्दी (Hindi)
   * hu  - Magyar (Hungarian)
   * nb  - Bokmål (Norwegian)
   * nn  - Nynorsk (Norwegian)
   * pt  - Português (Portuguese)
   * ro  - Românâ, Româneşte (Romanian)
   * sk  - Slovenčina (Slovak)
   * sl  - Slovenian (Slovene)
   * sv  - Svenska (Swedish)

Description: jump to things in Emacs tree-style
 This package provides a generic completion method based on building
 a balanced decision tree with each candidate being a leaf.  To
 traverse the tree from the root to a desired leaf, typically a
 sequence of `read-key' can be used.
 .
 In order for `read-key' to make sense, the tree needs to be
 visualized appropriately, with a character at each branch node.  So
 this completion method works only for things that you can see on
 your screen, all at once:
 .
  * character positions
  * word or subword start positions
  * line beginning positions
  * link positions
  * window positions
 .
 If you're familiar with the popular `ace-jump-mode' package, this
 package does all that and more, without the implementation
 headache.

 `bind-map' is an Emacs package providing the macro bind-map which can

 Emacs `evil-leader' package, and allows for an arbitrary number of
 "leader keys". This is probably best explained with an example.

 .
 It is not an end-user package, it is a library that is intended to be
 used by other packages.
 .
 Basically, at first you define 'list'/'info' interface using
 `bui-define-interface' macro, and then you can make user commands
 that will display entries using `bui-get-display-entries' and similar
 functions.

Description: behaviour-driven testing for Emacs Lisp packages
 Buttercup is a behavior-driven development framework for testing
 Emacs Lisp code. It allows the programmer to group related tests so
 they can share common set-up and tear-down code, and it allows the
 programmer to spy on functions to ensure they are called with the
 right arguments during testing.
 .
 The testing framework is inspired by the Jasmine JavaScript test framework.

 colors with a couple of flecks of light cream/brown/orange to break

 consult-buffer to switch between buffers and recently opened files. Furthermore
 Consult provides multiple search commands, an asynchronous consult-grep and
 consult-ripgrep, and the line-based search command consult-line. Some of the
 Consult commands are enhanced versions of built-in Emacs commands. For example
 the command consult-imenu presents a flat list of the Imenu with live preview,
 grouping and narrowing. Please take a look at the full list of commands.

Description: Emacs major mode for editing comma, char, and tab separated values
 This package implements CSV mode, a major mode for editing records in
 a generalised CSV (character-separated values) format.  It also
 features support for TSV (tab-separated values).  CSV mode supports
 operations such as the following:
 .
   * sort lexicographically and numerically on a specified
     field or column.
   * kill and yank by field or column.  C-c C-k can kill more than one
     field at once, but multiple killed fields can be yanked only as a
     fixed group equivalent to a single field.
   * align fields into columns.
   * interchange between rows and columns.
 .
 CSV mode can recognise fields separated by a number of individual
 characters, configurable in `csv-separators'.  CSV data fields can be
 delimited with quote characters.  This implementation supports quoted
 fields, where all permitted quote characters are specified in the
 customisable user option `csv-field-quotes'.  By default, the only
 separator is a comma and the only field quote is a double quote.
 .
 The global minor mode `csv-field-index-mode' displays the current
 field index in the mode line, cf. `line-number-mode' and
 `column-number-mode'.  It is on by default.

Description: table component for Emacs Lisp
 Table component for Emacs Lisp. Emacs Lisp programs can display a nice table
 view from an abstract data model. Many Emacs programs have the code for

Description: Emacs Mini-Buffer Actions Rooted in Keymaps
 Embark makes it easy to choose an Emacs command to run based on what is near
 point, both during a minibuffer completion session and in normal buffers. Bind
 the command embark-act to a key and it acts like prefix-key for a keymap of
 actions (commands) relevant to the target around point. With point on an URL in
 a buffer you can open the URL in a browser or eww or download the file it
 points to. If while switching buffers you spot an old one, you can kill it
 right there and continue to select another. Embark comes preconfigured with
 over a hundred actions for common types of targets such as files, buffers,
 identifiers, s-expressions, sentences; and it is easy to add more actions and
 more target types. Embark can also collect all the candidates in a minibuffer
 to an occur-like buffer or export them to a buffer in a major-mode specific to
 the type of candidates, such as dired for a set of files, ibuffer for a set of
 buffers, or customize for a set of variables.

Description: Matrix client for Emacs
 A Matrix client for Emacs aiming to be simple, fast, featureful and reliable.
 .
 The default formatting style resembles IRC clients, with each message being
 prefixed by the username (which enables powerful Emacs features, like using
 Occur to show all messages from or mentioning a user).  Alternative, built-in
 styles include an Element-like one with usernames above groups of messages,
 as well as a classic, no-margins IRC style.  Messages may be optionally
 displayed with unique colors for each user (with customizable contrast),
 making it easier to follow conversations.  Timestamp headers are optionally
 displayed where a certain amount of time passes between events, as well as
 where the date changes.

Description: assign files to Emacs projects, programmatically
 Eproject is a minor-mode that allows the grouping of related files
 as projects.  It aims to be as unobtrusive as possible -- no new
 files are created (or required to exist) on disk, and buffers that
 are not a member of a project are not affected in any way.  Where
 'auto-mode-alist activates MODE for FILE-REGEX, Eproject
 activates PROJECT-TYPE for FILES-IN-DIRECTORY, when
 PROJECT-TYPE-DEFINITION is true.  It also creates a customisable
 hook that is run whenever a file belonging to a project is visited.

 all of the callbacks have been called after a defined number of
 seconds.

Description: Emacs StartUp Profiler
 This package profiles your Emacs startup time by examining all
 top-level S-expressions (sexps). It starts a new Emacs process from
 Emacs to profile each sexp. After the profiled Emacs is complete, it
 will exit and your Emacs will display the results.
 .
 It will step into `require' and `load' forms at the top level of a
 file, but not if they're enclosed in any other statement.

Description: quick access to project files in Emacs
 This library provides methods for quickly finding any file in a project.  It
 uses GNU Find by default, but can also use (the significantly faster)
 fd-find.  Find-file-in-project supports the following candidate selection
 interfaces: Consult, Helm, Ido, Ivy, Selectrum, and the Emacs built-in
 'completing-read'.
 .
 By default, FFIP will search for files in a local Git, Subversion, or
 Mercurial repository.  FFIP uses TRAMP to find files in remote
 repositories, and claims this is "flawlessly" supported.
 .
 Features:
 .
   * Fast!  Tested with projects that have 50,000+ files
   * Find's behaviour can be tweaked using ffip-find-options
   * Smart! The keyword "helloWorld", returns "HelloWorld.html",
     "hello-world.css", and "HelloWorld.js".
   * Enhances diff-mode with more convenient patch-handling, including
     diff creation, application, finding the file associated with a given
     hunk, and jumping to the section relevant to that hunk
   * No configuration required.  Find-file-in-project works out-of-the-box
   * Supports evil-mode, with additional configuration (see README)

Description: sorting algorithm for fuzzy matching in Emacs
 The flx sorting algorithm for Emacs provides fuzzy matching for
 completion engines like Ido.  It is similar to the fuzzy matching
 functionality of Sublime Text.

 The user can input (i) characters from the beginning of the words of
 the desired match and (ii) substrings of the desired match.  For
 example, when matching "save-all-buffers", the user could input
 "sallb", and when matching "eval-buffer" the user could input
 "ebuffer".
 .
 The flx sorting algorithm implements an intelligent trade-off between
 word beginnings and contiguous substrings when ranking possible
 matches.

Description: folding-editor minor mode for Emacs
 This package provides an Emacs minor mode for folding (hiding) custom
 regions.  It also provides an Isearch interface to the folds.  Folds
 can be nested hierarchically.
 .
 Folding-mode is similar to a general-purpose Outline-mode or to
 Org-mode.  It can CLOSE a fold so that only initial special marker
 and optional fold name/comment are visible, or it can ENTER a fold so
 that all text outside of the target fold is hidden.
 .
 The upstream maintainers of folding-mode do not recommend exclusively
 relying on folding-mode for code layout and navigation.  Hideshow and
 Imenu are more appropriate for folding code at a per-function() level
 of granularity.  In particular Imenu is more useful for this because
 it parses function indexes.  Folding mode is most useful for dividing
 code into broad operations and for organising stubs while prototyping.

Description: state machine library
 fsm.el is an exercise in metaprogramming inspired by gen_fsm of
 Erlang/OTP. It aims to make asynchronous programming in Emacs Lisp
 easy and fun. By "asynchronous" I mean that long-lasting tasks
 don't interfer with normal editing.
 .
 Some people say that it would be nice if Emacs Lisp had threads
 and/or continuations. They are probably right, but there are few
 things that can't be made to run in the background using facilities
 already available: timers, filters and sentinels. As the code can
 become a bit messy when using such means, with callbacks everywhere
 and such things, it can be useful to structure the program as a
 state machine.
 .
 In this model, a state machine passes between different "states",
 which are actually only different event handler functions. The
 state machine receives "events" (from timers, filters, user
 requests, etc) and reacts to them, possibly entering another state,
 possibly returning a value.
 .
 The essential macros/functions are:
 ;;
 define-state-machine  - create start-FOO function
 define-state          - event handler for each state (required)
 define-enter-state    - called when entering a state (optional)
 define-fsm            - encapsulates the above three (more sugar!)
 fsm-send              - send an event to a state machine
 fsm-call              - send an event and wait for reply
 .
 fsm.el is similar to but different from Distel:
 <URL:http://fresh.homeunix.net/~luke/distel/>
 Emacs' tq library is a similar idea.

Description: generic completion mechanism for Emacs
 Ivy is an acronym for Incremental Vertical completYon.  While it
 operates similarly to other completion schemes, such as
 Icomplete mode, Ivy aims to be more efficient, smaller, simpler, and
 smoother to use--yet highly customisable.
 .
 To try Ivy, call M-x ivy-mode.  A default installation of Ivy only
 includes the generic completion framework, plus completion for file
 and buffer names.
 .
 This package will not install all of Ivy/Swiper/Counsel.  For a
 full-featured experience please install "elpa-counsel", which will
 also install "elpa-swiper".  Hydra users will probably also want
 "elpa-ivy-hydra".
 .
 Counsel is an alternative to Ido, Anything, and Helm.

Description: memoization functions
 This package provides memoization functions. `memoize' accepts a
 symbol or a function. When given a symbol, the symbol's function
 definition is memoized and installed overtop of the original function
 definition. When given a function, it returns a memoized version of
 that function.
 .
 Memoization takes up memory, which should be freed at some point.
 Because of this, all memoization has a timeout from when the last
 access was.

Description: directory tree sidebar for Emacs that is like NERDTree for Vim
 NeoTree is a modern, themeable alternative to the Emacs builtins
 Dired and Speedbar.  Like Speedbar, it auto-refreshes without needing
 to type "g".  Like Dired, but unlike Speedbar, it creates a new
 window as a sidebar and not a whole new frame (eg: not a new X11
 application window with its own window decorations).  NeoTree shows a
 file system tree relative to the users' $HOME, where both Dired and
 Speedbar default to showing the contents of the current directory.
 Thus it provides a hierarchical rather than a modal view.
 .
 Neotree is similar to Vim's NERDTree plugin.
 .
 This addon is for users who are more comfortable with the directory
 tree sidebar/file system explorer used in most non-Emacs applications.

Description: Emacs key and popup interface for complex keybindings
 Taking inspiration from prefix keys and prefix arguments, Transient
 implements a similar abstraction involving a prefix command, infix
 arguments and suffix commands. This abstraction could be called
 "transient command", but because it always involves at least two
 commands (a prefix and a suffix) it's preferable to call it just a
 "transient".
 .
 When the user calls a transient prefix command, then a transient
 (temporary) keymap is activated, which binds the transient's infix
 and suffix commands, and functions that control the transient state
 are added to `pre-command-hook' and `post-command-hook'. The
 available suffix and infix commands and their state are shown in
 the echo area until the transient is exited by invoking a suffix
 command.
 .
 Calling an infix command causes its value to be changed, possibly
 by reading a new value in the minibuffer.
 .
 Calling a suffix command usually causes the transient to be exited
 but suffix commands can also be configured to not exit the
 transient state.

Description: Emacs minor mode for handling undo history as tree
 Package undo-tree provided by this package replaces Emacs' undo
 system with a system that treats undo history as what it is: a
 branching tree of changes. This simple idea allows the more intuitive
 behaviour of the standard undo/redo system to be combined with the
 power of never losing any history. An added side bonus is that undo
 history can in some cases be stored more efficiently, allowing more
 changes to accumulate before Emacs starts discarding history.

Description: display available keybindings in popup
 `which-key' is a minor mode for Emacs that displays the key bindings
 following your currently entered incomplete command (a prefix) in a
 popup. For example, after enabling the minor mode if you enter C-x
 and wait for the default of 1 second the minibuffer will expand with
 all of the available key bindings that follow C-x (or as many as
 space allows given your settings). This includes prefixes like C-x 8
 which are shown in a different face.

Description: speech output interface to Emacs
 Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow someone who
 cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.
 .
 Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs. Once Emacs is started with Emacspeak
 loaded, users get spoken feedback for all actions. As Emacs can do
 everything, they get speech feedback for everything they do.
 .
 This package recommends the speech server for the espeak (software)
 speech synthesizer, so it should work straight away. However it also
 contains the source for speech servers to support the DECtalk Express
 and DECtalk MultiVoice (hardware) speech synthesizers. For other
 synthesizers, look for speech server packages such as emacspeak-ss and
 eflite.

Description: LLVM-to-JavaScript Compiler
 Emscripten is an LLVM to JavaScript compiler. It takes LLVM bitcode, also
 called LLVM IR (which can be generated from C/C++ using Clang, or any other
 language that can be converted into LLVM bitcode) and compiles that into
 JavaScript, which can be run on the web (or anywhere else JavaScript can run).
 .
 Using Emscripten, you can
   * Compile C and C++ code into JavaScript and run that on the web
   * Run code in languages like Python as well, by compiling CPython from C
     to JavaScript and interpreting code in that on the web
 .
 This package contains the documentation.

Description: Data files for the game enigma
 Enigma is a puzzle game similar to Oxyd on the Atari ST or Rock'n'Roll
 on the Amiga and good old Marble Madness. It also has Sokoban levels, and
 some interesting twists on the original sokoban concept.
 .
 In Enigma, your objective is to locate and uncover matching pairs of
 Oxyd stones. Simple as it sounds, this task is made more difficult by
 the fact that Oxyd stones tend to be hidden, inaccessible or protected
 by unexpected traps. Overcoming these obstacles often requires a lot
 of dexterity and wit (and can be quite addictive).

Description: Circumvent Debian package dependencies
 This package provides a tool to create trivial Debian packages.
 Typically these packages contain only dependency information, but they
 can also include normal installed files like other packages do.
 .
 One use for this is to create a metapackage: a package whose sole
 purpose is to declare dependencies and conflicts on other packages so
 that these will be automatically installed, upgraded, or removed.
 .
 Another use is to circumvent dependency checking: by letting dpkg
 think a particular package name and version is installed when it
 isn't, you can work around bugs in other packages' dependencies.
 (Please do still file such bugs, though.)

Description: Client to use a free encrypted cloud based network file system
 An easy-to-use, easy-to-setup, hassle-free secure file system with the
 encrypted data being stored on a remote cloud server without having to
 trust the server.
 .
 All key material is created on the user's computer and never stored or
 transferred to the server.
 .
 All data is locally encrypted (including the file name). The encrypted
 data (and only that!) is stored in the cloud. The data remains secure even
 if the cloud server is compromised. It does not need root or superuser
 privileges. No need to run your own server. All you need is the bash
 script (literally). It is one single command to add and use a
 file system:
 .
 $ erfs mount aDe5F2ik3x35x7pfAEAWdC5Y ~/secure

Description: Quantum chemistry program for large-scale calculations - data package
 ErgoSCF is a quantum chemistry program for large-scale self-consistent field
 calculations.  It employs modern linear scaling techniques like fast multipole
 methods, hierarchic sparse matrix algebra, density matrix purification, and
 efficient integral screening.  Linear scaling is achieved not only in terms of
 CPU usage but also memory utilization.  It uses Gaussian basis sets.
 .
 It can compute single-point energies for the following methods:
  * Restricted and unrestricted Hartree-Fock (HF) theory
  * Restricted and unrestricted Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT)
  * Full Configuration-Interaction (FCI)
 .
 The following Exchange-Correlational (XC) density functionals are included:
  * Local Density Approximation (LDA)
  * Gradient-corrected (GGA) XC functionals BLYP, BP86, PW91 and PBE
  * Hybrid XC functionals B3LYP, BHandHLYP, PBE0 and CAMB3LYP
 .
 Further features include:
  * Linear response calculations (polarizabilities and excitation energies) for
    restricted reference densities
  * External electric fields
  * Electron dynamics via Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF)
 .
 This package contains data for ergo.

Description: AST-based pattern checker for JavaScript
 ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns
 found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
 In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint
 with a few exceptions:
 .
  * ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing
  * ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code
  * ESLint is completely pluggable,
    every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime
 .
 Some uses of ESLint require additional packages:
  * Use of parsers other than the default (Espree) require that parser,
    e.g. node-babel-eslint, node-esprima, or node-esprima-fb.
  * Use of option --init require package node-inquirer.

Description: ESO VLT Instrument pipeline collection
 In collaboration with the various instrument consortia, the Pipeline Systems
 Department has undertaken to implement data reduction pipelines for the most
 commonly used VLT/VLTI instrument modes.  These data reduction pipelines have
 three main purposes:
 .
  * Data quality control: Pipelines are used to produce the quantitative
    information necessary to monitor instrument performance.
 .
  * Master calibration product creation: pipelines are used to produce master
    calibration products (e.g. combined bias frames, super-flats, wavelength
    dispersion solutions).
 .
  * Science product creation: using pipeline-generated master calibration
    products, science products are produced for supported instrument modes
    (e.g. combined ISAAC jitter stacks; bias-corrected, flat-fielded FORS
    images, wavelength-calibrated UVES spectra). The accuracy of the science
    products can be limited both by the quality of the available master
    calibration products and by the algorithmic implementation of the
    pipelines themselves. In particular, adopted reduction strategies may not
    be suitable for all scientific goals.
 .
 This metapackage will install all ESO VLT pipelines along with the
 environments needed to run them (esorex, python-cpl).

 form. Instead, items are created as free-form text entries using a
 simple, intuitive format and stored in plain text files.

Description: small and non-interactive scripting language (documentation)
 Execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language, like sh; but its
 syntax is quite different from a traditional shell syntax. The execlineb
 program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text file; the other
 commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb script.
 .
 Execline is as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops,
 getopt-style option handling, filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile, its
 syntax is far more logic and predictable than the shell's syntax, and has
 no security issues.

Description: configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration
 for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split
 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.

Description: Extra modules and scripts for CMake
 Extra CMake Modules, or ECM, aims to augment CMake with additional modules. It
 serves as both a staging ground for new modules before they are moved upstream
 to CMake and a place for modules that, for whatever reason, are not a good fit
 for CMake itself.
 .
 It is primarily driven by the needs of the KDE community, but it is hoped that
 other projects will find it useful, and outside contributions are always
 welcome. The main rule for new modules is that there must be at least two
 downstream users.
 .
 This package contains HTML documentation and man pages.

Description: semantic web reasoning engine
 Euler Yet another proof Engine (EYE) is a reasoning engine
 supporting the Semantic Web layers.
 It performs semibackward chaining and it supports Euler paths.
 Via N3 it is interoperable with Cwm.
 .
 Semibackward chaining
 is backward chaining for rules using <= in N3
 and forward chaining for rules using => in N3.
 This can be seen in EYE Reasoning.
 .
 Euler paths are roughly "don't step in your own steps"
 which is inspired by what Leonhard Euler discovered in 1736
 for the Königsberg Bridge Problem.
 EYE sees the rule P => C as P & NOT(C) => C.
 .
 Notation3 (N3) is a shorthand non-XML serialization
 of Resource Description Framework (RDF) models,
 designed with human-readability in mind:
 N3 is much more compact and readable than XML RDF notation.
 .
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model
 for data interchange on the Web.

Description: Eyes17 User Manuals (English version)
 Eyes17 provides high level interfaces for making science experiments
 with an ExpEYES-17 box.
 .
 This package contains user manuals in PDF and EPUB formats, in English
 .
 ExpEYES-17 is from the PHOENIX project of Inter-University Accelerator
 Centre, New Delhi. It is a hardware & software framework for
 developing science experiments, demonstrations and projects and learn
 science and engineering by exploration. Capable of doing real time
 measurements and analysing the data in different ways. When compared with
 previous ExpEYES boxes (Expeyes, Expeyes-Junior), ExpEYES-17 is richer
 in various features: multiple soft input ranges, more flexible wave
 generator, better time resolution, better voltage resolution, supports
 seamlessly cheap I2C sensors.

Description: automatically prepare storage devices
 Using FAI disk_config files, setup-storage computes effective
 partition and volume sizes and executes the necessary commands
 to configure storage devices. It manages disk drives as well
 as RAID and LVM volumes. It handles all file systems supported
 by parted(8) as well as ntfs but is flexible enough to be
 extended to further types as well. Once the storage devices
 are prepared, an appropriate fstab(5) file is generated.
 .
 This package provides the setup-storage utility as separate
 package so it can be used independent from FAI as well.

Description: ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors
 Fail2ban monitors log files (e.g. /var/log/auth.log,
 /var/log/apache/access.log) and temporarily or persistently bans
 failure-prone addresses by updating existing firewall rules.  Fail2ban
 allows easy specification of different actions to be taken such as to ban
 an IP using iptables or hostsdeny rules, or simply to send a notification
 email.
 .
 By default, it comes with filter expressions for various services
 (sshd, Apache, proftpd, sasl, etc.) but configuration can be
 easily extended for monitoring any other text file.  All filters and
 actions are given in the config files, thus fail2ban can be adopted
 to be used with a variety of files and firewalls.  Following recommends
 are listed:
 .
  - iptables/nftables -- default installation uses iptables for banning.
    nftables is also supported. You most probably need it
  - whois -- used by a number of *mail-whois* actions to send notification
    emails with whois information about attacker hosts. Unless you will use
    those you don't need whois
  - python3-pyinotify -- unless you monitor services logs via systemd, you
    need pyinotify for efficient monitoring for log files changes

Description: Save/restore system clock on machines without working RTC hardware
 Some machines don't have a working realtime clock (RTC) unit, or no
 driver for the hardware that does exist. fake-hwclock is a simple set
 of scripts to save the kernel's current clock periodically (including
 at shutdown) and restore it at boot so that the system clock keeps at
 least close to realtime. This will stop some of the problems that may
 be caused by a system believing it has travelled in time back to
 1970, such as needing to perform filesystem checks at every boot.
 .
 On top of this, use of NTP is still recommended to deal with the fake
 clock "drifting" while the hardware is halted or rebooting.

 The FASTA programs find regions of local or global similarity between
 Protein or DNA sequences, either by searching Protein or DNA databases,
 or by identifying local duplications within a sequence. Other
 programs provide information on the statistical significance of an
 alignment. Like BLAST, FASTA can be used to infer functional and
 evolutionary relationships between sequences as well as help identify
 members of gene families.

Description: Some papers about fastlink
 Genetic linkage analysis is a statistical technique used to map
 genes and find the approximate location of disease genes. There
 was a standard software package for genetic linkage called
 LINKAGE. FASTLINK is a significantly modified and improved
 version of the main programs of LINKAGE that runs much faster
 sequentially, can run in parallel, allows the user to recover
 gracefully from a computer crash, and provides abundant new
 documentation. FASTLINK has been used in over 1000 published
 genetic linkage studies.
 .
 You do not really need these papers about fastlink but it is highly
 recommended to study this documentation before starting with the
 tools of the fastlink package.

Description: quality control for high throughput sequence data
 FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on
 raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It
 provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick
 impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should
 be aware before doing any further analysis.
 .
 The main functions of FastQC are
  * Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
  * Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may
    be problems
  * Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
  * Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
  * Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without
    running the interactive application

Description: QTL mapper in cis for molecular phenotypes - documentation
 The goal of FastQTL is to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
 which are significantly associated with various molecular phenotypes
 (i.e. expression of known genes, cytosine methylation levels, etc).
 It performs scans for all possible phenotype-variant pairs in cis
 (i.e. variants located within a specific window around a phenotype).
 FastQTL implements a new permutation scheme (Beta approximation) to accurately
 and rapidly correct for multiple-testing at both the genotype and phenotype
 levels.
 .
 This package provides documentation and example data to work with FastQTL.

Description: simple battery power monitor for laptops with ACPI
 fdpowermon is a simple perl script that installs an icon in a system
 tray compatible with the freedesktop.org specification.
 .
 Every three seconds, fdpowermon calls acpi to find out what the current
 battery level is. It will set the output of the acpi command as a
 tooltip text, and will update the used icon as appropriate.
 .
 In addition, fdpowermon can optionally call perl subroutines when the
 power reaches a given level. No such subroutines are provided or
 enabled by default, however.

 waste if the oxygen-icon-theme package is not installed for other
 reasons. Therefore, this package contains just those icons from the
 oxygen-icon-theme package that are needed by fdpowermon, and nothing
 more.

Description: maintain and setup complicated firewall rules
 ferm is a frontend for iptables. It reads the rules from a
 structured configuration file and calls iptables(8) to insert them
 into the running kernel.
 .
 ferm's goal is to make firewall rules easy to write and easy to
 read. It tries to reduce the tedious task of writing down rules, thus
 enabling the firewall administrator to spend more time on developing
 good rules than the proper implementation of the rule.
 .
 To achieve this, ferm uses a simple but powerful configuration
 language, which allows variables, functions, arrays, blocks. It also
 allows you to include other files, allowing you to create libraries
 of commonly used structures and functions.
 .
 ferm, pronounced "firm", stands for "For Easy Rule Making".

Description: set of LaTeX macros for creating Feynman diagrams
 FeynMF is a LaTeX package for easy drawing of professional-quality Feynman
 diagrams, illustrations that depict the fundamental interactions of subatomic
 particles.  The diagrams may be created using either the Metafont
 or MetaPost programs.  FeynMF lays out most diagrams satisfactorily from the
 structure of the graph without any need for manual intervention.
 Nevertheless all the power of Metafont or MetaPost is available for more
 obscure cases.
 .
 Note that you will need the texlive-metapost package in order to use the
 MetaPost-based version of FeynMF.

Description: Domain DNS scanner
 Fierce is a semi-lightweight scanner that helps locate non-contiguous
 IP space and hostnames against specified domains. It's really meant as
 a pre-cursor to nmap, unicornscan, nessus, nikto, etc, since all of
 those require that you already know what IP space you are looking for.
 This does not perform exploitation and does not scan the whole internet
 indiscriminately. It is meant specifically to locate likely targets both
 inside and outside a corporate network.
 .
 Because it uses DNS primarily you will often find mis-configured networks
 that leak internal address space. That's especially useful in targeted malware.
 Originally written by RSnake along with others at http://ha.ckers.org/.
 This is simply a conversion to Python 3 to simplify and modernize the codebase.

Description: Converts xfig files into ps, eps or pdf files using LaTeX for processing text
 This perl script takes into advantage the pstex and pstex_t export
 formats of fig2dev (xfig) to separate special text and the rest of a xfig
 file. Then, the text is processed separately using LaTeX, and
 everything is put back together at the end, to make a nice wonderful
 figure with the text formatted exactly the same way as the article you
 are typing ! PDF output is also available.
 .
 Though gv is strictly speaking not necessary for conversion, it can
 be called directly by fig2ps depending on the options you choose.
 For nice PDF output, you should install Type 1 fonts, such as lmodern
 or cm-super.

Description: editor for Crystallographic Information Format
 Finalcif is a full-featured CIF file editor to make editing and validation of
 CIF files easy. It collects all the information from a work folder needed in
 order to finalize a CIF file for publication. In any case, one can also import
 a valid CIF file to complete the information. In ideal cases, it takes one
 click to have a publication-ready file.
 .
 Essentially, one should have the corresponding CIF file for FinalCif in its
 original 'work' folder, which contains all other files such as SAINT list
 files, SADABS list file, SHELX list files, etc. that led to this CIF file.
 .
 Checking the final CIF file with the IUCr CheckCIF server is a one-click
 problem in FinalCif. One gets a web and PDF report or just a local PLATON CIF
 check for computers without internet.
 .
 FinalCif generates beautiful CIF reports in seconds for publication as MS Word
 files (also compatible with Openoffice etc.). The report includes tables of
 structure properties like R-values or atom parameters and a report text about
 the experiment conditions.
 .
 The button "save cif file" saves the current file under 'name'-finalcif.cif.
 FinalCif will never make changes to the original CIF file.

Description: fitting genome coverage distributions with mixture models
 Genome coverage, the number of sequencing reads mapped to a position in
 a genome, is an insightful indicator of irregularities within sequencing
 experiments. While the average genome coverage is frequently used within
 algorithms in computational genomics, the complete information available
 in coverage profiles (i.e. histograms over all coverages) is currently
 not exploited to its full extent. Thus, biases such as fragmented or
 erroneous reference genomes often remain unaccounted for. Making this
 information accessible can improve the quality of sequencing experiments
 and quantitative analyses.
 .
 fitGCP is a framework for fitting mixtures of probability distributions
 to genome coverage profiles. Besides commonly used distributions, fitGCP
 uses distributions tailored to account for common artifacts. The mixture
 models are iteratively fitted based on the Expectation-Maximization
 algorithm.

Description: Multicast file distribution utility
 Flamethrower is intended to be an easy to use multicast file distribution
 system.  It was created to add multicast install capabilities to
 SystemImager, but was designed to be fully functional as a stand-alone
 package.
 .
 Notable characteristics:
  1)  Works with entire directory hierarchies of files, not just single files.
  2)  Uses a server configuration file that takes module entries that are
      similar to those used by rsyncd.conf.
  3)  Flamethrower is an on-demand system.  The multicast of a module is
      initiated when a client connects, but waits MIN_WAIT (conf file) for
      other clients to connect.  If other clients try to connect after a
      cast has been initiated, they simply wait until that cast has finished,
      and catch the next one when it begins.
  4)  The udpcast package is used as the multicast transport, and offers a
      gob and a half of tuning parameters.

Description: examines source code and looks for security weaknesses
 Flawfinder searches through C/C++ source code looking for potential
 security flaws and produces a report describing the potential flaws
 found in source code, ranking them by likely severity.
 .
 Like RATS, Flawfinder reports are not a direct indication of a
 vulnerability, but provide a reasonable starting point for performing manual
 security audits in source code.
 .
 Flawfinder can also generate differential reports by pointing it to
 a patch (diff) file describing the code changes. This way it can be used
 to determine if the potential flaws found in code have increased or
 decreased after a commit to a source code management system like
 CVS or Subversion.

Description: FLExible Network Tester for bufferbloat testing and more
 The FLExible Network Tester: Python wrapper to run multiple simultaneous
 netperf/iperf/ping instances and aggregate the results.
 .
 Tests are specified as config files (which are really Python), and
 various parsers for tool output are supplied. At the moment, parsers for
 netperf in -D mode, iperf in csv mode and ping/ping6 in -D mode are
 supplied, as well as a generic parser for commands that just outputs a
 single number.
 .
 Several commands can be run in parallel and, provided they output
 timestamped values, (which netperf ping and iperf do, the latter with a
 small patch, available in the misc/ directory), the test data points can
 be aligned with each other in time, interpolating differences between
 the actual measurement points. This makes it possible to graph (e.g.)
 ping times before, during and after a link is loaded.

Description: Documentation for flex (a fast lexical analyzer generator)
 Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. It reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. Flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.
 .
 This package contains the HTML documentation for flex.

Description: simple way to put Python packages and modules on PyPI (PEP 517)
 Flit is a easy way to put Python packages and modules on PyPI. It tries to
 require less thought about packaging and help you avoid common mistakes.
 .
 Flit supports PEP 517 Python packaging and PEP 621 project metadata.
 .
 Make the easy things easy and the hard things possible is an old motto from
 the Perl community. Flit is entirely focused on the easy things part of that,
 and leaves the hard things up to other tools.
 .
 Specifically, the easy things are pure Python packages with no build steps
 (neither compiling C code, nor bundling Javascript, etc.). The vast majority
 of packages on PyPI are like this: plain Python code, with maybe some static
 data files like icons included.

Description: non-linear video editor
 Flowblade Movie Editor is designed to provide a fast, precise and

 .
 Flowblade employs film style editing paradigm in which clips are
 usually automatically placed tightly after the previous clip - or
 between two existing clips - when they are inserted on the timeline.
 Edits are fine-tuned by trimming in and out points of clips, or by
 cutting and deleting parts of clips. Film style editing is faster for
 creating programs with mostly straight cuts and audio splits, but may
 be slower when programs contain complex composites unless correct work
 flow is followed.

 musescore-general-soundfont and musescore-general-soundfont-small).
 .
 It can be used with most modern MIDI synthesisers which support
 the SF3 format and has a low installed size footprint, while
 providing the large GM sound set. It does not, however, support
 Single-Note Dynamics with MuseScore 3.2 and higher.
 .
 As it comes under the MIT licence, it can be used in most settings,
 but do remember that waveforms generated using this soundfont are
 “copies or substantial portions of the” soundfont. It is sufficient
 to reproduce the licence and copyright notice in any “associated
 documentation files” provided with your generated waveforms.
 .
 This package will be installed into /usr/share/sounds/sf3/ which

Description: monospaces programming font
 This was an attempt at making a small, monospaced, outline font that would be
 geometrically regular and simple. The endeavor was motivated by a deep
 adoration of old-school console bitmap fonts, of Consolas, of Pragmata Pro,
 as well as a novice's curiosity for typographical design.

 designed to be easily and quickly read from a distance. Each letter exploits
 the most unique aspects of that individual letter so that each character can
 be easily distinguished from any other.

 v. to advise or warn). The Italian origin all'erta literally means on the
 lookout.

Description: vector font similar to ROM font of Amiga Workbench
 Inspired by the article Raster CRT Typography (According to DEC) by Norbert
 Landsteiner, these fonts were reworked on some old pixel versions of the
 Commodore 64 and Amiga Workbench. The author had done years ago to include
 variable font axes for the size of the horizontal scanlines and the amount
 of horizontal bleed of the pixels due to the phosphor latency found in CRT
 displays.
 .
 This is the Amiga Workbench font.

Description: fixed width font designed for coders
 This package contains two Font Families.
  - Anonymous Pro
  - Anonomous Pro Minus
 .
 "Anonymous Pro" is a family of four fixed-width fonts designed
 especially with coding in mind. Characters that could be mistaken for
 one another (O, 0, I, l, 1, etc.) have distinct shapes to make them
 easier to tell apart in the context of source code.
 .
 Anonymous Pro also features an international, Unicode-based character
 set, with support for most Western and European Latin-based languages,
 Greek, and Cyrillic. It also includes special “box drawing” characters
 for those who need them.
 .
 While Anonymous Pro looks great on Macs, Windows and Linux PCs with
 antialiasing enabled, it also includes embedded bitmaps for specific
 pixel sizes ("ppems" in font nerd speak) for both the regular and bold
 weight. (Since slanted bitmaps look pretty bad and hard to read at the
 supported sizes, it was chosen to use the upright bitmaps for the
 italics as well.) Bitmaps are included for these ppems: 10, 11, 12, and
 13.
 .
 "Anonymous Pro Minus" is a family of four fixed-width fonts designed
 especially with coding in mind. Characters that could be mistaken for
 one another (O, 0, I, l, 1, etc.) have distinct shapes to make them
 easier to tell apart in the context of source code.
 .
 Anonymous Pro Minus also features an international, Unicode-based character
 set, with support for most Western and European Latin-based languages,
 Greek, and Cyrillic. It also includes special "box drawing" characters
 for those who need them.
 .
 Unlike Anonymous Pro, Anonymous Pro Minus does not include embedded bitmaps.

Description: contemporary modern typeface
 This is a contemporary modern typeface with some features of a Bodoni, but
 the structures, soft lines, and finishes leave a calm and distinguished
 feeling. The first sketches were made during a vacation in Arapey, a small
 town the north of Uruguay. The italics are gentle, rhythmic, and bring a
 special glamour to both text use and titles.

 cleaned up from the original version. It has only a one pixel descent to
 maximize pixels available to the main body of each character.

Description: legible font designed to be used on aircraft cockpit screens
 In 2010, Airbus initiated a research collaboration with ENAC and Universite
 de Toulouse III on a prospective study to define and validate an Aeronautical
 Font: the challenge was to improve the display of information on the cockpit
 screens, in particular in terms of legibility and comfort of reading, and to
 optimize the overall homogeneity of the cockpit.
 .
 Two years later, Airbus came to find Intactile DESIGN to work on the design
 of the eight typographic variants of the font. This one, baptized B612 in
 reference to the imaginary asteroid of the aviator SaintExupery, benefited
 from a complete hinting on all the characters.
 .
 Main characteristics are:
  - Maximize the distance between the forms of the characters
  - Respect the primitives of the different letters
  - Harmonize the forms and their spacing

 This is a monospace font, similar to Courier. It was designed to replace the
 legendary Courier especially in screenwriting. It's Courier, just better.

 Courier and Courier Final Draft, so you can (mostly) swap it out one-for-one
 and your page count should not change.

Description: Pretty sweet 4px wide pixel font (strict character bounding box)
 The 'creep' font is a pretty compact font that is only 4 pixels wide. It is
 great for smaller screens, in order to be able to maintain high text density
 on screens reported as small as 11 inches in diagonal.
 .
 Box drawing
 .
 Creep has most of the basic box drawing characters implemented. Therefore
 creep usually works with most ncurses-type programs or with tmux
 window-splitting for example.
 .
 Powerline
 .
 Creep supports all the symbols needed for Lokaltog's awesome powerline plugin
 for vim.
 .
 Sparklines
 .
 Creep has the necessary symbols for creating sparklines. This is cool for
 tools like rainbarf and others.
 .
 Better Haskell syntax
 .
 This font contains characters that can be used to pretty-print Haskell
 symbols, like '>>='.
 .
 Braille and Drawille
 .
 Creep now supports the full braille alphabet, which was an easy thing to do
 because of the clever braille encoding scheme. All of the braille characters
 are simply generated using a little script.
 .
 Why creep2?
 .
 This rework is a manually hand painted glyphs of the original 'creep' font
 that works with terminals and editors that do not support negative spacing.
 Every glyph fits into a 5x11px bounding box. This makes certain glyphs less
 recognizable compaired to the original font.
 .
 The original 'creep' font can be found at <https://github.com/romeovs/creep>

Description: ancient Greek font revival
 John Baskerville (1706-1775) got involved in typography late in his
 career but his contribution was significant. He was a successful
 entrepreneur and possessed an inquiring mind which he applied to
 produce many aesthetic and technical innovations in printing. He
 invented a new ink formula, a new type of smooth paper and made
 various improvements in the printing press. He was also involved in
 type design which resulted in a latin typeface which was used for the
 edition of Virgil, in 1757.  The quality of the type was admired
 throughout of Europe and America and was revived with great success
 in the early 20th century. Baskerville was also involved in the
 design of a Greek typeface which he used in an edition of the New
 Testament for Oxford University, in 1763. He adopted the practice of
 avoiding the excessive number of ligatures which Alexander Wilson had
 started a few years earlier but his Greek types were rather narrow in
 proportion and did not win the sympathy of the philologists and other
 scholars of his time. They did influence, however, the Greek types of
 Giambattista Bodoni. and through him Didot's Greek in Paris.  The
 typeface has been digitally revived as GFS Baskerville Classic by
 Sophia Kalaitzidou and George D. Matthiopoulos and is now available
 as part of GFS' type library.

Description: smart greek typeface revival
 Giambattista Bodoni was the most prolific Italian typecutter of the
 18th century. He was among the first European typecutters to move
 away from the byzantine cursive tradition with the numerous ligatures
 which was the norm until then. His Greek types influenced many
 subsequent designers, yet they fell in disuse by the middle of the
 19th century.  GFS presented Bodoni's original Greek typeface in the
 commemorative edition of Pindar's Olympian Odes (2004), in digital
 version by George D. Matthiopoulos, and is now available for the
 general public. In the OpenType features, under ligatures, one may
 alternately use diphthongs with the accents placed in between the
 characters, as Giambattista Bodoni did when setting greek texts.

Description: greek font family (Classic Didot revival)
 Under the influence of the neoclassical ideals of the late 18th century, the
 famous French typecutter Firmin Didot in Paris designed a new Greek typeface
 (1805) which was immediately used in the publishing programme of Adamantios
 Korai, the prominent intellectual figure of the Greek diaspora and leading
 scholar of the Greek Enlightenment. The typeface eventually arrived in Greece,
 with the field press which came with Didot’s grandson Ambroise Firmin Didot,
 during the Greek Revolution in 1821.
 .
 Since then the typeface has enjoyed an unrivaled success as the type of choice
 for almost every kind of publication until the last decades of the 20th
 century. Didot's original type design, as it is documented in publications
 during the first decades of the 19th century, was digitized and revived by
 George D. Matthiopoulos in 2006 for a project of the Department of Literature
 in the School of Philosophy at the University of Thessaloniki, and is now
 available for general use.

Description: ancient Greek font (Byzantine cursive hand style)
 During the whole of the 18th century the old tradition of using Greek
 types designed to conform to the Byzantine cursive hand with many
 ligatures and abbreviations - as it was originated by Aldus Manutius
 in Venice and consolidated by Claude Garamont (Grecs du Roy) - was
 still much in practice, although clearly on the wane. GFS Gazis is a
 typical German example of this practice as it appeared at the end of
 that era in the 1790's. Its name pays tribute to Anthimos Gazis
 (1758-1828), one of the most prolific Greek thinkers of the period,
 who was responsible for writing, translating and editing numerous
 books, including the editorship of the important Greek periodical
 Ερμής ο Λόγιος (Litterary Hermes) in Wien.  GFS Gazis has been
 digitally designed by George D. Matthiopoulos.

Description: modern Greek font family with matching Latin
 Neohellenic is a Greek font family characterized by round, even pen
 strokes. It consists of several weights (normal, italic, bold, and
 bold italic) as well as a Latin version.
 .
 Former Greek types had harked back to classical models. In 1927,
 Victor Scholderer chose instead to revive one which had first
 appeared in a 1492 printing of Macrobius attributed to Joannes
 Rubeus. In 1993-4 the typeface was digitized by the Greek Font
 Society, with the addition of a new set of epigraphic symbols.

Description: ancient Greek oblique font revival (companion to GFS Didot)
 In Greece the terms italic and oblique have the same meaning since
 they are borrowed from the latin typographic practice without any
 real historical equivalent in Greek history. Until the end of the
 19th century Greek typefaces were cut and cast independently, not as
 members of a typefamily. The mechanisation of typecutting allowed the
 transformation of upright Greek typefaces to oblique designs.
 Nonetheless, the typesetting practice of a cursive Greek font to
 complement an upright one did not survive the 19th century. The
 experimental font GFS Olga (1995) attempts to revive this lost
 tradition. The typeface was designed and digitised by George
 Matthiopoulos, based on the historical Porson Greek type (1803) with
 the intention to be the companion of the upright GFS Didot font
 whenever there is a need for an italic alternative.

Description: Greek font (Porson revival)
 In England, during the 1790's, Cambridge University Press decided to procure a
 new set of Greek types. The university’s great scholar of Classics, Richard
 Porson was asked to produce a typeface based on his handsome handwriting and
 Richard Austin was commissioned to cut the types. The type was completed in
 1808, after the untimely death of Porson the previous year. Its success was
 immediate and since then the classical editions in Great Britain and the
 U.S.A.  use it, almost invariably. In 1913, Monotype released the typeface
 with some corrections, notably replacing the upright capitals suggested by
 Porson with inclined ones. In Greece the typeface was used under the name
 Pelasgika type. GFS Porson is based on the Monotype version, though using
 upright capitals, as in the original.

Description: ancient Greek oblique font
 From the middle of the 19th century an italic font with many
 calligraphic overtones was introduced into Greek printing. Its source
 is unknown, but it almost certainly was the product of a German or
 Italian foundry. In the first type specimen printed in Greece by the
 typecutter K. Miliadis (1850), the font was listed anonymously along
 others of 11pts and in the Gr. Doumas' undated specimen appeared as
 «11pt Greek inclined». For most of the second half of the century the
 type was used extensively as an italic for emphasis in words,
 sentences or excerpts. In 1889, the folio size Type Specimen of
 Anestis Konstantinidis' publishing, printing and type founding
 establishment also included the type as «Greek inclined [9 & 12 pt]».
 .
 Nevertheless, the excessively calligraphic style of the characters,
 combined with the steep and uncomfortable obliqueness of the
 capitals, was out of favour in the 20th century and the type did not
 survive the conformity of the mechanical type cutting and casting.
 The font has been digitally revived, as part of our typographic
 tradition, by George D.  Matthiopoulos and is part of GFS' type
 library under the name GFS Solomos, in commemoration of the great
 Greek poet of the 19th century, Dionisios Solomos.

 .
 Its complex and heavily decorative design does point to aesthetic
 codes which preoccupied his artistic expression and, although
 impractical for contemporary text setting, it remains an original
 display face, or it can be used as initials.  The book design
 workshop of the Fine Arts School of Athens has been recently
 reorganised, under the direction of professor Leoni Vidali, and with
 her collaboration George D. Matthiopoulos has redesigned digitaly
 this historical font which is now available as GFS Theokritos.

Description: Typeface designed for source code
 No frills. No gimmicks. Hack is hand groomed and optically balanced to be a
 workhorse face for code.
 .
 It has deep roots in the libre, open source typeface community and expands upon
 the contributions of the Bitstream Vera & DejaVu projects. The face has been
 re-designed with a larger glyph set, modifications of the original glyph shapes
 (including distinct point styles and semi-bold punctuation weight in the
 regular set to make analphabetic characters less transparent), and meticulous
 attention to metrics (including numerous spacing adjustments to improve the
 rhythm of the face and the legibility of code at small text sizes). The large
 x-height + wide aperture + low contrast design combined with PostScript
 hinting/hint replacement programs and a TrueType instruction set make it highly
 legible at commonly used source code text sizes with a sweet spot that runs in
 the 8px - 12px range on modern desktop and laptop monitors.
 .
 This package contains the TrueType fonts and the Webfont (WOFF/WOFF2) versions.

 lettering of that period, the “Havava” design is detail oriented, coherent

 font’s name itself refers to a former cafe “Havana” in Warsaw.

Description: authentic secretary hand font
 The Joscelyn font is named for John Joscelyn (1529-1604), secretary to Matthew
 Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1559 to 1575. Among the first Englishmen
 to recover the ability to read the Old English language, Joscelyn compiled an
 Old English dictionary, contributed to Parker's published works, and wrote
 Historiola Collegii Corporis Christi, a short history of Corpus Christi
 College, Cambridge, Parker's college.
 .
 This font is based on the elegant hand of a scribe who produced the copy of
 Joscelyn's Historiola in MS Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, 488. It is, as
 far as known, the only attempt to produce an accurate and uncompromising
 reproduction of the notoriously difficult Renaissance secretary hand in a
 digital font, using OpenType features to represent the cursive and highly
 variable character of the hand.
 .
 To use this font, you must make sure that two OpenType features are turned on
 in your software: Contextual Alternates (calt) and Standard Ligatures (liga).

Description: script font that feels like writing quickly with an inked brush
 When making digital typefaces, the more you refine the shapes of the letters,
 the more energy you take away from them. Because of that, Kaushan Script
 is unrefined - and carries a lot of energy.
 .
 By avoiding typographical sophistication, it stays more natural. The angles
 of the vertical strokes varies and the baseline jumps around, giving it a more
 rustic and natural feeling.
 .
 And while most script fonts look too small when used at regular sizes on the
 web, Kaushan Script is optimized to keep it readable when used as small as
 16 pixels.

Description: classic ATF Typo Script revival font
 Math typesetting requires an ornate capital script font for symbols such as
 script-H (Hilbert space), script-P (powerset), and so on. The most commonly
 used such font in TeX is rsfs (Ralph Smith's Formal Script), which is based on
 the classic ATF Typo Script. Many of the ATF script fonts have been
 professionally digitized, but not this one.
 .
 The lines of the Typo Script digitization are much more delicate and refined,
 largely because they're based on the 18pt metal, while rsfs is designed for a
 10pt normal and 7pt subscript size. Thus, this draft can't really be used as a
 drop-in replacement, as the hairlines will simply be too light to reproduce
 well. At some point, the digital adaptation of the ATF optical scaling
 technology will be working, allowing to produce more robust versions
 suitable for use in text-sized mathematical setting.

Description: bold condensed script with many ligatures and alternates
 The beauty of real hand-drawn lettering is that the lettering artists subtly
 modify the shape of letters so they connect with the next ones. These linked
 letters-pairs are called "ligatures". Thus, in order to provide a smooth
 hand-written look, the Lobster font provides a large number of ligatures,
 as well as terminal forms (i.e. glyphs that are used for word endings).

Description: geometric, constructed sans serif font
 From a stylistic point of view, Millimetre is a geometric, constructed sans
 serif, with quite wide proportions even if the width of several glyphs could
 contradict this statement. With its rectangular look and closed terminals,
 Millimetre reminds us of 60’s sans such as Aldo Novarese's Eurostile. Far
 from running away from this graphic universe, Millimetre embraces the
 retro-futuristic, architectural, technological and science-fictional
 connotations that come with it.

 BIZ UD Gothic is a universal design typeface designed to be easy to

 legible and well-balanced design sans serif. In order to make the kanji
 more clear and identifiable, the letterforms are simplified by omitting
 hane (hook) and geta (the vertical lines extending beyond horizontal
 strokes at the bottom of kanji). Counters and other spaces are finely
 adjusted so that the overall balance of the type is not impaired even
 with the use in relatively large size. The kana are made slightly
 smaller than the kanji to give a good rhythm and flow when setting long
 texts in the lighter weights.

Description: ANSI font readable by the computers of the 1960s
 This font was developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
 to be readable by the computers of the 1960s. The OCR-A font is still used
 commercially in payment advice forms so that a lockbox company can determine
 the account number and amount owed on a bill when processing a payment.
 A site license for the OCR-A font is very expensive, so this free font was
 created.

Description: largely geometric, friendly and open curves font
 Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
 largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
 curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,
 Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural
 width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in
 humanist and serif types.
 .
 This is the normal family, which can be used alongside the Roboto Condensed
 family and the Roboto Slab family.
 .
 This package also provides Css, Scss and LESS files to use webfonts from this
 package.

Description: Ethiopic script font designed in a calligraphic style
 Abyssinica SIL has a single face - regular.
 .
 The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font
 that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
 Ethiopic-based writing system. In addition, there is provision for other
 Latin characters and symbols. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font
 technologies to support the need to position arbitrary combinations of
 *Ethiopic* base glyphs and combining marks optimally. It also supports
 almost 200 kerning pairs. This version of the font also supports Stylistic
 Sets and Character Variants (OpenType) or Features (Graphite) which make
 glyph alternates available for a number of Ethiopic and punctuation
 characters. See the AbyssinicaSILOpenTypeFontFeatures.pdf,
 AbyssinicaSILGraphiteFontFeatures.pdf and AbyssinicaSILTypeTunerGuide.pdf
 for details on applications which support Stylistic Sets and how to access
 them.
 .
 One font from this typeface family is included in this release:
 .
     * Abyssinica SIL Regular

Description: Font for Arabic-based writing systems in the Kano region
 Alkalami is the local word for the Arabic "qalam", a type of sharpened stick
 used for writing on wooden boards in the Kano region of Nigeria and in Niger,
 and what gives the style its distinct appearance. The baseline stroke is very
 thick and solid. The ascenders and other vertical strokes including the teeth
 are very narrow when compared to the baseline. A generous line height is
 necessary to allow for deep swashes and descenders, and the overall look of
 the page is a very black, solid rectangle. Diacritics are much smaller in
 scale, with very little distance from the main letters.
 .
 This font supports the characters known to be used by languages written with
 the Kano style of Arabic script, but may not have the characters needed for
 other languages.
 .
 This font utilizes state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex
 typographic issues. Font smarts are implemented using OpenType only. There
 are no current plans to support Graphite.
 .
 Two fonts are included in this release:
    * Alkalami Regular
    * Alkalami Light Regular
 .

Description: Font family designed for literacy use
 Andika ("Write!" in Swahili) is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font
 designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of
 beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms that
 will not be easily confused with one another.
 .
 A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching
 people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than some serif
 fonts can be. For years, literacy workers have had to make do with fonts
 that were available but not really suitable for beginning readers and
 writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to tediously cobble
 together letters from a variety of fonts in order to get the all of
 characters they need for their particular language project, resulting in
 confusing and unattractive publications. Andika addresses those issues.
 .
 Four fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
     * Andika Regular
     * Andika Bold
     * Andika Italic
     * Andika Bold Italic

Description: Smart Unicode Latin/Greek fonts for literacy (tight spacing version)
 Andika ("Write!" in Swahili) is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font
 designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of

 .
 After receiving many insightful comments on the Design Review and Basic fonts,
 Andika's final letterforms have been refined with alternate shapes still
 available for some characters. This font now contains the same character set
 as Charis SIL and Doulos SIL.
 .
 Andika  provides OpenType and Graphite features like smart code for diacritic
 placement and supports recent additions to Unicode and the SIL PUA, and
 character assignments are updated to conform to Unicode 5.1
 .
 See the FONTLOG for information on this and previous releases.

 This is the compact version to allow more flexibility with diacritics.

 will not be easily confused with one another.

 .
 Andika New Basic is a limited-character-set (no extended IPA or Cyrillic)
 version of Andika that includes regular, bold, italic and bold-italic faces.
 Andika New Basic gives a preview of what a whole range of new weights will
 eventually look like.
 .
 A hallmark of Andika's versatility for global use is its selection of
 alternate letterforms. These alternates are accessible via OpenType and
 Graphite font features. For applications that do not support OpenType or
 Graphite, TypeTuner Web (http://scripts.sil.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi) allows
 you to download a custom font with your choice of which forms should be
 the default. TypeTuner is also available as a standalone utility -
 (http://scripts.sil.org/TypeTuner).
 .
 Andika New Basic is a limited-character-set version of Andika that includes
 a full family of styles (Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold-Italic).
 .
 In particular, these fonts do not support:
   Full extended Latin IPA
   Complete support for Central European languages
   Greek
   Cyrillic
 .
 What is the difference between Andika and Andika New Basic?
   Andika has a more complete character set comparable to
     Charis SIL and Doulos SIL
   Andika New Basic has a limited character set, supporting only the Basic
     Latin and Latin-1 Supplement Unicode ranges, plus a selection of the
     more commonly used extended Latin characters, with miscellaneous
     diacritical marks, symbols and punctuation.
   Andika New Basic has all four faces: Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold-Italic
 .
 What is the difference between Andika Basic (2008) and Andika New Basic?
   Andika New Basic has all four faces: Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold-Italic
   Andika New Basic has a few more characters than Andika Basic
   Andika New Basic uses different glyphs for "a" and "r" based characters
     than Andika Basic, and are identical to the main Andika font
   Graphite feature identifiers were integers in Andika Basic and are
     4-character alphanumeric tags in Andika New Basic
 .
 The full-character-set Andika is being updated to include all four faces
 (Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold-Italic).

Description: smart font for languages using Devanagari script
 These fonts are named after the majestic Annapurna mountain range of Nepal.

 diverse languages that use Devanagari script to produce readable, high-quality
 publications. The design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably
 compact, and visually attractive.
 .
 Annapurna SIL has a calligraphic design that reflects the stroke contrast of
 writing the characters with a broad nib used for Devanagari.

Description: Smart Unicode font for the Nastaliq script
 Awami Nastaliq is a Nastaliq-style Arabic script font supporting a wide variety
 of languages of Southwest Asia, including but not limited to Urdu. This font
 is aimed at minority language support. This makes it unique among Nastaliq
 fonts.
 .
 Awami means "of the people", "of the common population" or "public".

 characters defined in Unicode for Arabic script. Because the font style is
 specifically intended for languages using the Nastaliq style of southwest Asia,

Description: Font family for wide range of languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic scripts
 Charis is similar to Bitstream Charter, one of the first fonts designed
 specifically for laser printers. It is highly readable and holds up well in
 less-than-ideal reproduction environments. It also has a full set of styles
 - regular, italic, bold, bold italic - and so is more useful in general
 publishing than Doulos SIL. Charis is a serif proportionally spaced font
 optimized for readability in long printed documents.
 .
 The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font family
 that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
 Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or
 orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other characters and

 The goal for Charis SIL is to provide a single Unicode-based font family
 that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost
 any Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or
 orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other characters
 and symbols useful to linguists.
 .
 The Charis SIL font contains near-complete coverage of all the characters
 defined in Unicode 7.0 for Latin and Cyrillic. In total, over 3,600 glyphs are
 included, providing support for over 2,300 characters as well as a large number
 of ligated character sequences (e.g., contour tone letters used in phonetic
 transcription of tonal languages).
 .
 Four fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
    * Charis SIL Compact Regular
    * Charis SIL Compact Bold
    * Charis SIL Compact Italic
    * Charis SIL Compact Bold Italic
 .
 Charis SIL is a TrueType font with "smart font" capabilities added using the
 Graphite, OpenType(r), and AAT font technologies. This means that complex
 typographic issues such as formation of ligatures or automatic positioning of
 diacritics relative to base characters in arbitrary base+diacritic combinations
 (including combinations involving multiple diacritics) are handled by the font.
 In addition, alternately-designed glyphs are also provided for a number of
 characters for use in particular contexts. These capabilities are only
 available if you are running an application that provides an adequate level of
 support for one of these smart font technologies.
 .
 This is the compact version with tighter line spacing.

Description: smart Unicode font for Dai Banna (Xishuangbanna Dai)
 This package provides the Dai Banna SIL fonts which are a Unicode
 rendering of the New Tai Lue (Xishuangbanna Dai) script.  Version 2.000 is the
 first Unicode release.  (Version 1.0 was released under the name of 'SIL Dai
 Banna' in legacy encoding.)  Two font families, differing only in weight,
 allow for a wide range of uses.
 .
 The New Tai Lue script is used by approximately 300,000 people who speak the
 Xishuangbanna Dai language in Yunnan, China.  It is a simplification of the
 Tai Tham (Old Tai Lue) script as used for this language for hundreds of years.
 .
 The Dai Banna SIL fonts are smart fonts using a Graphite description. The
 source package includes the source GDL code for the description. The features
 of the fonts are:
 .
  - complete coverage of the New Tai Lue script
  - Graphite smarts for re-ordrant vowels and line-breaking
 .
 Extended Font sources (Graphite .gdl and FontLab .vfb) are available in the
 source package and on the project website.

Description: Font family for wide range of languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic scripts
 Doulos is very similar to Times/Times New Roman, but only has a single
 face - regular. It is intended for use alongside other Times-like fonts where
 a range of styles (italic, bold) are not needed.
 .
 The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font family
 that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
 Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or
 orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other characters and
 symbols useful to linguists. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font
 technologies to support complex typographic issues, such as the need to
 position arbitrary combinations of base glyphs and diacritics optimally.
 .
 One font from this typeface family is included in this release:
     * Doulos SIL Regular
 .
 Webfont versions and HTML/CSS examples are also available.
 .
 The full font sources are publicly available at
 https://github.com/silnrsi/font-doulos
 An open workflow is used for building, testing and releasing.

Description: smart Unicode font for Latin and Cyrillic scripts (tight spacing version)
 The goal for the Doulos SIL font is to provide a single Unicode-based font
 family that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for
 almost any Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for
 phonetic or orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other
 characters and symbols useful to linguists.
 .
 The Doulos SIL font contains near-complete coverage of all the characters
 defined in Unicode 7.0 for Latin and Cyrillic. In total, over 3,600 glyphs are
 included, providing support for over 2,300 characters as well as a large number
 of ligated character sequences (e.g., contour tone letters used in phonetic
 transcription of tonal languages).
 .
 In addition, alternately-designed glyphs are also provided for a number of
 characters for use in particular contexts. The glyphs are accessible in
 applications that support advanced font technologies, specifically the Graphite
 or OpenType technologies. These technologies are also utilized to provide
 automatic positioning of diacritics relative to base characters in arbitrary
 base+diacritic combinations (including combinations involving multiple
 diacritics).
 .
 Doulos SIL is a TrueType font with "smart font" capabilities added using the
 Graphite, OpenType(r), and AAT font technologies. This means that complex
 typographic issues such as formation of ligatures or automatic positioning of
 diacritics relative to base characters in arbitrary base+diacritic combinations
 (including combinations involving multiple diacritics) are handled by the font.
 In addition, alternately-designed glyphs are also provided for a number of
 characters for use in particular contexts. These capabilities are only
 available if you are running an application that provides an adequate level of
 support for one of these smart font technologies.
 .
 This is the compact version with tighter line spacing.

Description: extended Unicode Latin font ("a typeface for the nations")
 Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family
 designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use
 the Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications. The design
 is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually
 attractive. Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design"
 in two major international typeface design competitions: bukva:raz! (2001)
 and TDC2003 (2003).
 .
 Gentium provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Greek characters. The
 additional 'extended' Latin letters are designed to naturally harmonize with
 the traditional 26 ones. Diacritics are treated with careful thought and
 attention to their use. Gentium also supports both ancient and modern Greek,
 including a number of alternate forms. It currently supports the following
 ranges of Unicode 3.0 (completely unless noted):
 .
  Range          Description
 .
  U+0020-U+007F  Basic Latin
  U+00A0-U+00FF  Latin-1 Supplement
  U+0100-U+017F  Latin Extended-A
  U+0180-U+021F  Latin Extended-B
  U+0222-U+0233  Latin Extended-B (continued)
  U+0250-U+02AD  IPA Extensions
  U+02B0-U+02FF  Spacing Modifier Letters
  U+0300-U+036F  Combining Diacritical Marks
  U+0370-U+03D5  Greek (not including archaic or Coptic)
  U+1E00-U+1EFF  Latin Extended Additional
  U+1F00-U+1FFF  Greek Extended
  U+2000-U+203A  General Punctuation (partial)
  U+2070-U+209F  Superscripts and Subscripts
  U+20A0-U+20CF  Currency Symbols (partial)
  U+2100-U+214F  Letterlike Symbols (only a couple)
 .
 Gentium Regular also includes some Cyrillic glyphs, but they are only early
 drafts. A future version will include a completely revised set, including
 italic, and will expand the support for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic to Unicode
 4.1.
 .
 GentiumAlt is an alternate font with flatter diacritics, specifically
 designed for languages using multiple accents.
 .
 The extended sources (Fontlab .vfb) for this font family are available
 in the source package and on the project website.

Description: smart Unicode font families (Basic and Book Basic) based on Gentium
 Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic are font families based on the original
 Gentium design, but with additional weights. The "Book" family is slightly
 heavier. Both families come with a complete regular, bold, italic and bold
 italic set of fonts.
 .
 The supported character set, however, is much smaller than for the main
 Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts support only the Basic Latin and Latin-1
 Supplement Unicode ranges, plus a selection of the more commonly used extended
 Latin characters, with miscellaneous diacritical marks, symbols and
 punctuation. A much more complete character set will be supported in a future
 version of the complete Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts are intended as a
 way to provide additional weights for basic font users without waiting until
 the complete Gentium character set is finished.
 .
 There are, however, some wonderful new features that are still missing from
 the main Gentium family:
  * Bold
  * Bold Italic
  * The slightly-heavier Book family
  * OpenType and Graphite smart code for diacritic placement
  * A few useful OpenType and Graphite features
  * Support for a few more recent additions to Unicode
  * Character assignments updated to Unicode 5.1

Description: Arabic script font designed for use by languages in West Africa
 Harmattan, named after the trade winds that blow during the dry season in
 West Africa, is designed in a Warsh style to suit the needs of languages
 using the Arabic script in West Africa.
 .
 This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 13.0 Arabic character
 repertoire (excluding the Quranic annotation signs in the Arabic Extended-A
 block and excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not
 recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented using OpenType
 and Graphite technologies.
 .
 This font uses state-of-the-art OpenType and Graphite font technologies,
 including variant glyphs for a number of characters for use in particular
 contexts.
 .
 This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic
 connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures
 or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This
 simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic
 languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and
 literate communities.
 .
 Two fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
     * Harmattan Regular
     * Harmattan Bold

Description: Unicode font for Yi (a script used in southwestern China)
 The Nuosu SIL font was originally named SIL Yi and developed in 2000
 as a single Unicode font for the standardized Yi script used by a
 large ethnic group in southwestern China.
 .
 The traditional Yi scripts have been in use for centuries, and have a
 tremendous number of local variants. The script was standardized in the
 1970's by the Chinese government. In the process of standardization, 820
 symbols from the traditional scripts of the Liangshan region were chosen
 to form a syllabary.
 .
 The syllable inventory of a speech variety from Xide County, Sichuan
 was used as the phonological basis for standardization. For the most part
 there is one symbol per phonologically-distinct syllable and vice-versa.
 The direction of writing and reading was standardized as left-to-right.
 Punctuation symbols were borrowed from Chinese, and a diacritic was
 incorporated into the system to mark one of the tones.
 .

Description: smart Unicode font for Arabic
 Scheherazade, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian Nights
 tale, is designed in a similar style to traditional typefaces such as
 Monotype Naskh, extended to cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire.
 .
 The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font
 family that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed
 for almost any Arabic-based writing system. This font makes use of
 state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex typographic
 issues.
 .
 This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using
 basic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional
 ligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef
 ligatures). This simplified style is often preferred for clarity,
 especially in non-Arabic languages, but may be considered unattractive
 in more traditional and literate communities.
 .
 One font from this typeface family is included in this release:
     - Scheherazade Regular
 .
 This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 5.0 Arabic
 character repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks,
 which are not recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented
 using OpenType technology.
 Webfont versions and HTML/CSS examples are also available.

Description: typeface reflecting the traditional hand-written style of the Tai Viet script
 The original Tai Heritage font was designed to reflect the traditional
 hand-written style of the Tai Viet script that is treasured by the Tai people
 of Vietnam. This gives it its angular style and flowing lines, as opposed to
 the more rounded style used by Lao and some modern versions of Tai Viet.
 .
 The current Tai Heritage Pro release is Unicode encoded, based on the
 Unicode 5.2 standard. It uses either the SIL Graphite technology or OpenType
 for correct placement of combining marks (vowels and tones).
 .
 The Tai Dam, Tai Daeng and Tai Don people who live in northwestern Vietnam and
 surrounding areas have a long tradition of literacy in the Tai Viet script.
 Their languages belong to the Tai-Kadai language family and are closely
 related to Lao.

Description: font for Zaghawa Beria (script used in western Sudan and eastern Chad)
 This alphabet is built around a sampling of the markings on livestock
 (especially camels) within the Zaghawa Beria language region of
 western Sudan and eastern Chad. It is an idea that has its origins in
 the work of a Sudanese schoolteacher, who developed the first version
 of this over 25 years ago. The script has since been better adapted
 to the Zaghawa Beria language by Siddik Adam Issa, and he has found a
 great enthusiasm by the people for what he has put together.
 .
 Note that this font is not encoded according to The Unicode Standard,
 as the Zaghawa Beria script has not yet been accepted into the
 standard.

Description: vector font similar to ROM font of Commodore 64
 Inspired by the article Raster CRT Typography (According to DEC) by Norbert
 Landsteiner, these fonts were reworked on some old pixel versions of the
 Commodore 64 and Amiga Workbench. The author had done years ago to include
 variable font axes for the size of the horizontal scanlines and the amount
 of horizontal bleed of the pixels due to the phosphor latency found in CRT
 displays.
 .
 This is the Commodore 64 font.

Description: Sans-serif style CJK font derived from Droid
 WenQuanYi Micro Hei font family is a sans-serif style (also known as Hei,
 Gothic or Dotum among the Chinese/Japanese/Korean users) high quality
 CJK outline font. It was derived from "Droid Sans Fallback", "Droid
 Sans" and "Droid Sans Mono" released by Google Corp. This font package
 contains two faces, "Micro Hei" and "Micro Hei Mono", in form of a
 TrueType Collection (ttc) file. All the unified CJK Han glyphs, i.e.
 GBK Hanzi, in the range of U+4E00-U+9FC3 defined in Unicode Standard 5.1
 are covered, with additional support to many other international
 languages such as Latin, Extended Latin, Hanguls and Kanas. The font
 file is extremely compact (~5M) compared with most known CJK fonts.
 As a result, it can be used for hand-held devices or embedded systems, or
 used on PC with a significantly small memory footprint. Because both
 font faces carry hinting and kerning instructions for Latin glyphs,
 they are excellent choices for desktop fonts.

Description: "WenQuanYi Zen Hei" A Hei-Ti Style (sans-serif) Chinese font
 WenQuanYi Zen Hei is a Hei-Ti style (sans-serif type) Chinese font.
 It was designed for general purpose text formatting and on-screen
 display of Chinese characters among many other languages. The embolden
 strokes of the font glyphs produces enhanced screen contrast, making
 it easier to read and recognize. The embedded bitmap glyphs further
 enhance on-screen performance, and can be enabled with the provided
 configuration files.
 .
 WenQuanYi Zen Hei provides a fairly complete coverage of Chinese
 Hanzi glyphs, including both simplified and traditional forms.
 The total glyph number in this font is over 35,000, including over
 21,000 Chinese Hanzi. This font provides full coverage of GBK (CP936)
 charset, CJK Unified Ideographs, as well as the code-points needed
 for zh_CN, zh_SG, zh_TW, zh_HK, zh_MO, ja (Japanese) and ko (Korean)
 locales for fontconfig.
 .
 Starting from version 0.8, this font package provides two font families,
 i.e. the proportional "WenQuanYi Zen Hei", and the monospaced typeface
 named "WenQuanYi Zen Hei Mono".

 Yanone Kaffeesatz was first published in 2004. Its Bold is reminiscent
 of 1920s coffee house typography, while the rather thin fonts bridge
 the gap to present times. You can witness Kaffeesatz use on German
 fresh-water gyms, Dubai mall promos and New Zealand McDonalds ads.
 And of course on coffee and foodstuff packaging and cafe design around
 the globe.
 .
 In 2010 it was decided to be re-released under the SIL Open Font
 License to make it possible to include in software bundles or web font
 services like Googles Font Directory.

Description: OpenPrinting printer support - Compressed PPDs derived from the database

 common printers for use with Debian (and other operating systems).
 It provides the "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and
 your actual printer, by telling your computer how to process files

 .
 This package contains all PPD files which can be generated from the Foomatic
 database as one small compressed archive. This reduces the disk space
 consumption compared to the Foomatic XML database vastly and in addition
 makes listing of all available PPDs and extracting the needed PPD much faster
 than using the Foomatic XML database.

Description: Forensics Environment - extra console components (metapackage)
 This package provides the extra components for a forensics environment. All
 here available tools are text console based. None of these tools were packaged
 by Debian Security Tools Team. This metapackage includes the most programs to
 data recovery, rootkit and exploit search, filesystems and memory analysis,
 image acquisition, volume inspection, passwords crackers, dictionaries (all
 put in /usr/share/dict), disassemblers, special actions over the hardware and
 many other activities.
 .
 The idea is provide several packages via APT, to avoid forgetting something
 when creating a specialized environment, specifically designed to operate
 outdoor.
 .
 There are not an intent to provide tools for remote attacks. So, some packages
 can be provided to allow a local analyses over pcap files. Other packages can
 be used to find vulnerabilities inside a LAN which is being investigated.
 .
 Other examples are hexedit and mc packages. mc provides mcview. The hexedit
 and mcview are able to manipulate very large files.

Description: Set of files to help learn/test forensics tools and techniques (metapackage)
 forensics-samples is a set of useful files to help to learn or test forensics
 tools and techniques. These files are examples of pictures, filesystems and
 other possible artifacts as memory dumps (not available yet).
 .
 forensics-samples is useful for students and CI tests. The main intent of this
 work is provide a standardized set of files to avoid time waste in some tasks
 when learning about forensics or testing tools.
 .
 There are some filesystem images available (currently: ext2, ext4, btrfs,
 NTFS, FAT2 (vfat) and exFAT). Inside each filesystem image, all files from
 "original-files" directory were copied and, after this, all directories ending
 with "2" in their names were deleted. Is possible use tools to analyse the
 files and their metadata or carvers to recover deleted files.
 .
 On Debian, forensics-samples also is useful to provide files to be used by
 other packages in CI tests (autopkgtest), making several source-packages
 smallest (e.g.: metacam, ext4magic, foremost, magicrescue, disktype, etc).
 All you need is use it as a dependency for your test in
 debian/tests/control file.

Description: Set of files to help learn/test forensics tools and techniques (multiple FS)
 forensics-samples is a set of useful files to help to learn or test forensics
 tools and techniques. These files are examples of pictures, filesystems and
 other possible artifacts as memory dumps (not available yet).

 forensics-samples is useful for students and CI tests. The main intent of this
 work is provide a standardized set of files to avoid time waste in some tasks
 when learning about forensics or testing tools.
 .
 There are some filesystem images available (currently: ext2, ext4, btrfs,
 NTFS, FAT2 (vfat) and exFAT). Inside each filesystem image, all files from
 "original-files" directory were copied and, after this, all directories ending
 with "2" in their names were deleted. Is possible use tools to analyse the
 files and their metadata or carvers to recover deleted files.

Description: use of psfrag constructs with pdflatex
 psfrag is a LaTeX package which allows one to replace text elements in
 included EPS graphics by arbitrary LaTeX output. Because psfrag uses
 Postscript for making the replacements, in principle you can't use
 psfrag with pdflatex which doesn't have any interfaces to postscript.
 .
 This package contains the Perl script fragmaster that produces a new
 EPS from your original EPS which already contains all those psfrag
 replacements. This new EPS graphic actually can be converted to PDF
 including all replacements. The resulting "encapsulated" PDF then can
 be used with pdflatex.

Description: Extensible Open Source CAx program
 For 3D printing, CNC milling or for the manual assembly of complicated
 constructs one needs a formal specification of the workpiece, i.e.,
 its parts and how these come together. The process to get there is
 called Computer-Aided Design (CAD). The process to transform a CAD
 model into a series of instructions that can be performed on a machine
 is called Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM). FreeCAD can do both, the
 prior yet a bit better than the latter.
 .
 FreeCAD is an Open Source CAx RAD based on OpenCasCade, Qt and Python.
 It features some key concepts like macro recording, workbenches, ability
 to run as a server and dynamically loadable application extensions and
 it is designed to be platform independent.
 .
 Currently, FreeCAD can import and display CAD models in IGES, STEP, and
 BRep formats and meshes in STL, BMS, AST and Wavefront OBJ formats.
 Editing and modeling features are currently somewhat limited.
 .
 This is a metapackage of FreeCAD component packages.

Description: Provides the documentation of the FreeFem++ FE suite
 FreeFem++ is an implementation of a language dedicated to the finite
 element method. It enables you to solve Partial Differential
 Equations (PDE) easily.
 .
 Problems involving PDE from several branches of physics such as
 fluid-structure interactions require interpolations of data on
 several meshes and their manipulation within one program. FreeFem++
 includes a fast quadtree-based interpolation algorithm and a language
 for the manipulation of these data on multiple meshes. It contains
 also a powerful mesh generation and adaption tool integrated
 seamlessly in FreeFem++ called bamg.
 .
 FreeFem++ is written in C++ and the FreeFem++ language is a C++ idiom
 allowing for a smooth learning curve.
 .
 This package contains the documentation files of FreeFem++.

Description: Java program for working with Mind Maps
 Freeplane is a free and open source software application that supports
 thinking, sharing information and getting things done at work, in school
 and at home. The core of the software is tools for mind mapping (also
 known as concept mapping or information mapping) and using mapped
 information.
 .
 Occupying the middle ground between an editor and a diagramming tool,
 Freeplane allows the user to add content as quickly and naturally as they
 would in a text editor, yet producing structured content that can be
 manipulated as easily as a diagram.
 .
 Features include ordering ideas in nodes and freely positionable
 nodes, connecting nodes, automatic/conditional styles, scripting,
 add-ons, LaTeX, search/filtering, different export features, printing,
 password protection of nodes/maps and more.
 .
 See http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page for a full
 list of applications and features.

Description: Facilitates production of HTML tables
 Freetable is a perl script that aims to make the production of HTML
 tables a little easier.  This script works as a filter, reading stdin
 and writing to stdout.
 .
 The input syntax is as roughly follows:
 .
       <wwwtable table-options...>
         initial text (e.g. <caption> ... </caption>).
         (X, Y) options for cell (X, Y)
         text for cell (X,Y)...
         ((X,Y)) options for header cell X,Y
         text for header cell (X,Y)...
       </wwwtable>
 .
 Rows and cells may be specified in any order, numbering starts at 1.
 X and/or Y may be replaced by regular expression, explicit range
 or even arbitrary Perl code to indicate rows or columns.
 Options or text (or both) may be omitted for cells.  Cells
 may be omitted completely if they are empty or fall under the
 rowspan/colspan specifications of another cell.  Cells may contain
 arbitrary HTML text, including other freetable tables.

Description: File system synchronization tool (1-way, over SSH)
 fssync is a 1-way file-synchronization tool that tracks inodes and maintains a
 local database of files that are on the remote side, making it able to:
  - handle efficiently a huge number of dirs/files
  - detect renames/moves and hard-links
 .
 It aims at minimizing network traffic and synchronizing every detail of a file
 system:
  - all types of inode: file, dir, block/character/fifo, socket, symlink
  - preserve hard links
  - modification time, ownership/permission/ACL, extended attributes
  - sparse files
 .
 Other features:
  - it can be configured to exclude files from synchronization
  - fssync can be interrupted and resumed at any time, making it tolerant to
    random failures (e.g. network error)
  - algorithm to synchronize file content is designed to handle big files
    like VM images efficiently, by updating fixed-size modified blocks in-place
 .
 Main usage of fssync is to prevent data loss in case of hardware failure,
 where RAID1 is not possible (e.g. in laptops).
 .
 On Btrfs file systems, fssync is an useful alternative to `btrfs send` (and
 `receive`) commands, thanks to filtering capabilities. This can be combined
 with Btrfs snapshotting at destination side for a full backup solution.

  - Responsive — adapting perfectly to the available screen space,
    to work on all sorts of devices.
  - Customisable — change the color palette, font families, logo and more!
  - Easy to navigate — with carefully-designed sidebar navigation and
    inter-page links.
  - Good looking content — through clear typography and well-stylised elements.
  - Good looking search — helps readers find what they want quickly.
  - Biased for smaller docsets — intended for smaller documentation sets,
    where presenting the entire hierarchy in the sidebar is not overwhelming.

Description: spamassassin plugin to check image attachments
 This Spamassassin plugin checks for specific keywords in image/gif,
 image/jpeg or image/png attachments, using gocr (an optical character
 recognition program).  This plugin can be used to detect spam that
 puts all the real spam content in an attached image, while the mail
 itself is only random text and random html, without any URL's or
 identifiable information.  Additionally to the normal OcrPlugin, it
 can do approximate matches on words, so errors in recognition or
 attempts to obfuscate the text inside the image will not cause the
 detection to fail.
 .
 This is a development version from SVN. Currently, this SVN
 version is the only one that works with spamassassin 3.2.

Description: FireWall KNock OPerator - Apparmor profile
 The FireWall KNock OPerator implements an authorization scheme called
 Single Packet Authorization (SPA), based on Netfilter and libpcap.
 .
 Its main application is to protect services such as OpenSSH with
 an additional layer of security in order to make the exploitation of
 vulnerabilities (both 0-day and unpatched code) much more difficult.

Description: Python powered Fortran preprocessor
 Fypp is a Python powered preprocessor. It can be used for any programming
 languages but its primary aim is to offer a Fortran preprocessor, which helps
 to extend Fortran with condititional compiling and template metaprogramming
 capabilities. Instead of introducing its own expression syntax, it uses Python
 expressions in its preprocessor directives, offering the consistency and
 versatility of Python when formulating metaprogramming tasks. It puts strong
 emphasis on robustness and on neat integration into developing toolchains.

Description: GDL library from D. Fannings IDL courses
 The Coyote Library evolved from work David Fanning was doing teaching
 IDL courses and answering IDL questions on the IDL newsgroup. It is
 meant to be a well-documented library that demonstrates how to write
 solid IDL/GDL programs that are easy to maintain and extend.
 .
 The main content of the library is the Coyote Graphics System (CGS),
 a collection of Coyote Library programs that turn the traditional
 GDL/IDL graphics commands (e.g., Plot, Contour, Surface, TV, etc.)
 into modern programs.
 .
 The most important features of Coyote Graphics System are:
 .
  * The commands work identically on the display, in PostScript, and
    in the Z-graphics buffer.
  * The commands can be displayed automatically in resizable graphics
    windows.
  * The commands automatically create high quality PostScript, PDF,
    and raster file output.
  * CGS graphics visualizations can be saved and restore later, or
    e-mailed to colleagues.
  * The commands work identically in an indexed or decomposed color
    environment.
  * The commands can use colors by name (e.g., "red", "dodger blue").
  * CGS commands are faster (often much faster) than the equivalent
    IDL function graphics commands.
  * Greek letters and other symbols can be directly embedded in Coyote
    Graphics text.
  * The commands fix the most annoying quirks (e.g., contour holes and
    levels) in traditional IDL commands.

Description: Fast key-value DB in Go - development files for embedding.
 BadgerDB is an embeddable, persistent and fast key-value (KV)
 database written in pure Go. It is the underlying database for Dgraph
 (https://dgraph.io), a fast, distributed graph database. It's meant
 to be a performant alternative to non-Go-based key-value stores like
 RocksDB.  Project Status [Jun 26, 2019] Badger is stable and is being
 used to serve data sets worth hundreds of terabytes. Badger supports
 concurrent ACID transactions with serializable snapshot isolation
 (SSI) guarantees. A Jepsen-style bank test runs nightly for 8h, with
 --race flag and ensures the maintenance of transactional guarantees.
 Badger has also been tested to work with filesystem level anomalies,
 to ensure persistence and consistency.
 .
 Badger v1.0 was released in Nov 2017, and the latest version that is
 data-compatible with v1.0 is v1.6.0.
 .
 Badger v2.0, use a new storage format which won't be compatible with all of
 the v1.x.
 .
 This package contains the Go library.

Description: Maven plugin for custom access modifier checking
 This maven plugin allows applications to define custom
 access modifiers programmatically, to be enforced at
 compile time in the opt-in basis. Obviously, there's no
 runtime check either --- this is strictly a voluntary
 annotation.
 .
 This mechanism is useful for actually making sure that
 deprecated features are not used (without actually removing
 such declarations, which would break binary compatibility.)

Description: library for checking accessibility in ODF/ODT documents using Libreoffice
 AccessODF is an extension that can be used in OpenOffice.org Writer and in
 LibreOffice Writer. It enables authors to find and repair accessibility issues
 in their documents, i.e.  issues that make their documents difficult or even
 impossible to read for people with disabilities. This includes issues such as:
  * insufficient colour contrast between text and background,
  * missing text alternatives for images and other objects (such text
    alternatives are necessary for blind users and other users of
    text-to-speech software),
  * missing language identification for the document and for language changes
    inside the document (language information is needed for conversion into
    Braille and synthetic speech),
  * the use of proper Heading styles instead of big bold text to identify
    headings (this enables document navigation based on headings),
  * the use of proper tables instead of visually mimicking tables by using tabs
    or spaces,
  * the compatibility of images with DAISY, the de-facto standard for digital
    talking books.
 For each accessibility issue, AccessODF provides a description and repair
 suggestions.
 .
 This package just contains the library for use in other programs.

Description: Examples for the ADIOS Adaptable IO system
 The Adaptable IO System (ADIOS) provides a simple, flexible way for scientists
 to describe the data in their code that may need to be written, read,
 or processed outside of the running simulation. By providing an external
 to the code XML file describing the various elements, their types, and
 how you wish to process them this run, the routines in the host code
 (either Fortran or C) can transparently change how they process the data.

Description: API to handle application configuration through Java properties file
 OWNER was written because the code dealing with the configuration is
 frequently repetitive, redundant, it’s made of static classes, singletons,
 long list of methods just doing conversion from a string property to a named
 method returning a Java primitive or a basic Java object.
 .
 OWNER solves the problem providing an interface object that
  - is easy to mock, easy to pass to other objects (via dependency injection);
  - declaratively maps the configuration without any redundancy;
  - can easily expand the loading logic in order to have multiple configuration
  files, multiple level of overriding (global configuration, user-level,
  defaults, etc);
  - doesn’t need to have an actual properties file backing the configuration,
  if one uses @DefaultValue.
  - provides a lot of features, like hot reloading, variables expansion, etc;
  - leaves one free to do everything one is already doing with
  java.util.Properties;
  - does support a super powerful type conversion, which includes arrays,
  collections, many standard Java objects, and even the possibility to plug
  one's own conversion logic.

 .
 The Java Boot Classpath Detector is an executable jar file which tries to
 determine the boot classpath of the Java Runtime and outputs that classpath to
 the standard output.
 .
 Animal Sniffer Annotations provides Java 1.5+ annotations which allow marking
 methods which Animal Sniffer should ignore signature violations of. Animal
 Sniffer is designed to detect when you have used classes/methods/fields which
 are not part of the JRE that you are targeting. There are certain situations
 when you might be compiling with a newer JDK than the JRE you are targeting.
 .
 The Animal Sniffer ANT Tasks can be used to build signatures of APIs and to
 check your classes against previously generated signatures.
 .
 The Animal Sniffer Enforcer Rule is used to check your classes against
 previously generated signatures.
 .
 The Animal Sniffer Maven Plugin is used to build signatures of APIs and to
 check your classes against previously generated signatures.

Description: Unit Test framework for ANTLR grammars
 gUnit is a "Unit Test" framework for ANTLR grammars. It provides a simple
 way to write and run automated tests for ANTLR grammars in a manner similar
 to Java unit testing framework jUnit. The basic idea is to create a bunch of
 input/output pairs for rules in a grammar and gUnit will verify the expected
 output/result. The input can be a single line or multiple lines of strings or
 even an external file. The output can be simply success or failure, an
 abstract syntax tree (AST), a rule return value, or some text output which
 could be a rule's template return value. The current version of gUnit has 2
 main functions, interpreter and jUnit generator. The interpreter interprets
 your gUnit script and runs unit tests using Java reflection to invoke methods
 in your parser objects. The generator, on the other hand, translates your
 gUnit script to jUnit Java code that you can compile and execute by hand.

Description: library to sign and verify Android APKs
 apksig is a project which aims to simplify APK signing and checking
 whether APK's signatures should verify on Android. apksig supports
 JAR signing (used by Android since day one) and APK Signature Scheme
 v2 (supported since Android Nougat, API Level 24).
 .
 The key feature of apksig is that it knows about differences in APK
 signature verification logic between different versions of the
 Android platform. apksig can thus check whether a signed APK is
 expected to verify on all Android platform versions supported by the
 APK. When signing an APK, apksig will choose the most appropriate
 cryptographic algorithms based on the Android platform versions
 supported by the APK being signed.
 .
 apksig library offers three primitives:
 .
  * ApkSigner which signs the provided APK so that it verifies on all
 Android platform versions supported by the APK. The range of platform
 versions can be customized if necessary.
 .
  * ApkVerifier which checks whether the provided APK is expected to
 verify on all Android platform versions supported by the APK. The
 range of platform versions can be customized if necessary.
 .
  * (Default)ApkSignerEngine which abstracts away signing an APK from
 parsing and building an APK file. This is useful in optimized APK
 building pipelines, such as in Android Plugin for Gradle, which need
 to perform signing while building an APK, instead of after. For
 simpler use cases where the APK to be signed is available upfront,
 the ApkSigner above is easier to use.
 .
 NOTE: Some public classes of the library are in packages having the
 word “internal” in their name. These are not public API of the
 library. Do not use *.internal.* classes directly.

Description: C++ header-only command line processing library
 So many different command line processing libraries out there and none
 of them just work! Some bring their whole extended family of related and
 unrelated external dependencies (yes, I'm looking at you Boost). Some
 require quirky syntax and/or very verbose setups that sacrifice
 simplicity for the generation of a cute usage message and validation.
 Many come to dominate your main() file and yet others do not build on
 multiple platforms - for some even their own tests and trivial usage
 cause crashes on some systems. Argh!
 .
 If you're writing a highly-sophisticated command line tool, then
 Boost.Program_options and its kind might give you many advanced options.
 However, if you need to get up and running quickly, effectively and with
 minimal fuss, give the single header-file argh a try.

Description: Library for parsing GNU style command line arguments (documentation)
 Argtable is an ANSI C library for parsing GNU style command line arguments.
 It enables a program's command line syntax to be defined in the source code as
 an array of argtable structs. The command line is then parsed according to that
 specification and the resulting values are returned in those same structs where
 they are accessible to the main program. Both tagged (-v, --verbose, --foo=bar)
 and untagged arguments are supported, as are multiple instances of each
 argument. Syntax error handling is automatic and the library also provides the
 means for displaying the command line syntax directly from the array of
 argument specifications.
 .
 This package contains the documentation for the development libraries for the
 libargtable2-dev package.

 .
 ASM offer similar functionality as other bytecode frameworks, but it is
 focused on simplicity of use and performance. Because it was designed and
 implemented to be as small and as fast as possible, it makes it very
 attractive for using in dynamic systems.

Description: SOAP implementation in Java
 Apache AXIS is an implementation of the SOAP ("Simple Object Access Protocol")
 submission to W3C.
 .
 From the draft W3C specification:
 .
 SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a decentralized,
 distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol that consists of three
 parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a message
 and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of
 application-defined datatypes, and a convention for representing remote
 procedure calls and responses.
 .
 This project is a follow-on to the Apache SOAP project.

 Bi-directional URI dispatch. Like compojure, but when you want to go both
 ways. If you are serving REST resources, you should be
 providing links to other resources, and without full support for forming URIs
 from handlers your code will become coupled with your routing. In short,
 hard-coded URIs will eventually break.

Description: Java API to biological data and applications (default version)
 BioJava is an open-source project dedicated to providing a Java framework
 for processing biological data. It includes objects for manipulating
 sequences, file parsers, DAS client and server support, access to BioSQL
 and Ensembl databases, and powerful analysis and statistical routines
 including a dynamic programming toolkit.
 .
 BioJava is provided by a vibrant community which meets annually at
 the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) that traditionally
 accompanies the Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB)
 meeting. Much like BioPerl, the employment of this library is valuable
 for everybody active in the field because of the many tricks of the
 trade one learns just by communicating on the mailing list.
 .
 This is a dependency package which should enable smooth upgrades to new
 versions.

Description: Java API to biological data and applications (version 1.9)
 This package presents the Open Source Java API to biological databases
 and a series of mostly sequence-based algorithms. The APIs are not
 compatible between versions. In analogy to the dealing with shared
 libraries of the C language, the jar file of this package has the
 API version in its name. It is symbolically linked to the expected
 biojava.jar filename in the package libbiojava-java. This will help
 keeping multiple versions of the biojava API in parallel.

Description: Java API to biological data and applications (default version)
 BioJava is an open-source project dedicated to providing a Java framework
 for processing biological data. It includes objects for manipulating
 sequences, file parsers, server support, access to BioSQL
 and Ensembl databases, and powerful analysis and statistical routines
 including a dynamic programming toolkit.
 .
 BioJava is provided by a vibrant community which meets annually at
 the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) that traditionally
 accompanies the Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB)
 meeting. Much like BioPerl, the employment of this library is valuable
 for everybody active in the field because of the many tricks of the
 trade one learns just by communicating on the mailing list.
 .
 This is a wrapper package which should enable smooth upgrades to new
 versions.

Description: Boilerplate removal and fulltext extraction from HTML pages
 The boilerpipe library provides algorithms to detect and remove the surplus
 "clutter" (boilerplate, templates) around the main textual content of a web
 page.
 .
 The library already provides specific strategies for common tasks (for example:
 news article extraction) and may also be easily extended for individual problem
 settings.
 .
 Extracting content is very fast (milliseconds), just needs the input document
 (no global or site-level information required) and is usually quite accurate.

Description: Runtime code generation for the Java virtual machine
 Byte Buddy is a code generation and manipulation library for creating
 and modifying Java classes during the runtime of a Java application and
 without the help of a compiler. Other than the code generation utilities
 that ship with the Java Class Library, Byte Buddy allows the creation of
 arbitrary classes and is not limited to implementing interfaces for the
 creation of runtime proxies. Furthermore, Byte Buddy offers a convenient
 API for changing classes either manually, using a Java agent or during a
 build.

Description: Java bytecode manipulation library
 The library presents itself as a collection of routines to manipulate Java
 bytecode. It allows for the dynamic creation of Java class files without
 using of Javac. Such tailored code can be used, i.e. as for the upstream's
 motivation of the BioJava developers, to generate implementations of
 Hidden Markov Models. It thus acts much like inline assembly for Java.

 Caffeine provides an in-memory cache using a Google Guava inspired API.
 The improvements draw on the experience designing Guava's cache and
 ConcurrentLinkedHashMap.
 .
 Caffeine provides flexible construction to create a cache with a combination
 of the following features:
  * Automatic loading of entries into the cache, optionally asynchronously
  * Size-based eviction when a maximum is exceeded based on frequency
    and recency
  * Time-based expiration of entries, measured since last access or last write
  * Asynchronously refresh when the first stale request for an entry occurs
  * Keys automatically wrapped in weak references
  * Values automatically wrapped in weak or soft references
  * Notification of evicted (or otherwise removed) entries
  * Writes propagated to an external resource
  * Accumulation of cache access statistics

Description: packaging tool for Java applications with Maven coordinates
 A capsule is a single executable JAR that contains everything an application
 needs to run either in the form of embedded files or as declarative metadata.
 Maven Capsule is a capsule that allows the creations of capsules that, instead
 of embedding their dependencies, download all or some of them from a Maven
 repository. The dependencies are downloaded, cached locally, and shared among
 other capsules that also depend on them. In addition, this capsule allows
 specifying capsule metadata in a POM file in addition to the manifest.
 .
 A capsule with the Maven caplet that has all (or almost all) of its
 dependencies downloaded rather than embedded is known as a "thin" capsule (as
 opposed to a "fat" capsule, which embeds all of its dependencies). In fact, a
 capsule may not contain any of the application's classes/JARs at all. Instead,
 the capsule's manifest may contain these attributes alone (and no files in the
 capsule JAR besides the manifest). When the capsule is launched, the newest
 available version of the application will be downloaded, cached and launched.
 .
 This package contains a fork of the original capsule-maven project. This fork
 is suited as a dependency of nextflow.

Description: Data binding framework for Java (XML, Objects, DB) - XML Schema
 Castor is a data binding framework for Java. It's the shortest path between
 Java objects, XML documents and relational tables.
 .
 Castor XML is an XML data binding framework. Unlike the two main XML APIs,
 DOM (Document Object Model) and SAX (Simple API for XML) which deal with
 the structure of an XML document, Castor enables you to deal with the
 data defined in an XML document through an object model which represents
 that data.
 .
 Castor XML can be compared to XMLBeans framework.
 .
 Castor JDO is an Object-Relational Mapping and Data-Binding Framework.
 Castor can map relational database data into Java Data Object based
 on user-defined mapping schema. In the other point-of-view,
 it provides java data objects a persistence layer.
 .
 This package contains a module with Castor XML schema support and provides
 functionality to reading, processing and writing XML schema documents.

 readable. Changes include vertical alignment, redirection, and special
 notation for Clojure functions.
 .
 This library also provides a hook for Leiningen to enable clj-stacktrace
 across all the projects that use clojure.test and clojure.stacktrace in
 general. It also allows clj-stacktrace to be used in the repl.

Description: Lisp dialect for the JVM (library)
 Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual
 Machine. It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the
 approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with
 an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming.
 Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode,
 yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is
 supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java
 frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that
 calls to Java can avoid reflection.
 .
 Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data
 philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a
 functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable,
 persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers
 a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that
 ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.
 .
 This package contains the library.

Description: Java library to reliably execute external processes from within the JVM
 Executing external processes from Java is a well-known problem
 area. It is inherently platform dependent and requires the developer
 to know and test for platform specific behaviors, for example
 using cmd.exe on Windows or limited buffer sizes causing deadlocks.
 The JRE support for this is very limited, albeit better with the
 new Java SE 1.5 ProcessBuilder class.
 .
 Reliably executing external processes can also require knowledge of
 the environment variables before or after the command is executed. In
 J2SE 1.1-1.4 there is no support for this, since the method,
 System.getenv(), for retrieving environment variables is deprecated.
 .
 There are currently several different libraries that for their own
 purposes have implemented frameworks around Runtime.exec() to handle
 the various issues outlined above. The commons-exec package aims
 at coordinating and learning from these initiatives to create and
 maintain a simple, reusable and well-tested package.

 Commons RDF aims to provide a common library for RDF 1.1 with implementations
 for common Java RDF frameworks like RDF4J, Apache Jena as well as for other
 libraries such as OWLAPI, Clerezza and other JVM languages.
 .
 The main motivation behind this simple library is to revise an historical
 incompatibility issue between these toolkits. This library does not pretend to
 be a generic API wrapping those libraries, but is a set of common Java
 interfaces for the RDF 1.1 concepts, e.g. 'IRI', 'BlankNode', 'Graph',
 accompanied with unit test cases for their expected behaviour, and a 'simple'
 implementation, which main purpose is to clarify the tests and interfaces.

Description: industrial-strength lock-free queue for C++
 Features
  * Knock-your-socks-off blazing fast performance.
  * Single-header implementation. Just drop it in your project.
  * Fully thread-safe lock-free queue. Use concurrently from any number
    of threads.
  * C++11 implementation -- elements are moved (instead of copied)
    where possible.
  * Templated, obviating the need to deal exclusively with pointers --
    memory is managed for you.
  * No artificial limitations on element types or maximum count.
    Memory can be allocated once up-front, or dynamically as needed.
  * Fully portable (no assembly; all is done through standard C++11
    primitives).
  * Supports super-fast bulk operations.
  * Includes a low-overhead blocking version (BlockingConcurrentQueue).
  * Exception safe.
 .
 Reasons to use
 .
 There are not that many full-fledged lock-free queues for C++. Boost has
 one, but it's limited to objects with trivial assignment operators and
 trivial destructors, for example. Intel's TBB queue isn't lock-free,
 and requires trivial constructors too. There're many academic papers
 that implement lock-free queues in C++, but usable source code is hard
 to find, and tests even more so.
 .
 This queue not only has less limitations than others (for the most part),
 but it's also faster. It's been fairly well-tested, and offers advanced
 features like bulk enqueueing/dequeueing (which, with the new design, is
 much faster than one element at a time, approaching and even surpassing
 the speed of a non-concurrent queue even under heavy contention).

Description: Eclipse Help System Core
 The Platform User Assistance component provides the mechanisms for making the
 Eclipse applications easier to use. These mechanisms are made available
 throughout usage life cycle and include initial user experience (welcome),
 online documentation, dynamic help, search, cheat sheets, automation and
 samples.
 .
 The goal of this component is to make it easier for users to accomplish their
 tasks in Eclipse applications. While it includes the traditional book-based
 help system, increasing effort is spent towards bringing assistance closer to
 the user. Welcome, dynamic help view and cheat sheets are examples of user
 assistance vehicles that can be used that way.

Description: Eclipse JDT Annotations for Enhanced Null Analysis
 Eclipse JDT Core is the Java infrastructure of the Eclipse Java IDE.
 It includes:
  * An incremental Java compiler. Implemented as an Eclipse builder, it is based
    on technology evolved from VisualAge for Java compiler. In particular, it
    allows one to run and debug code which still contains unresolved errors.
  * A Java Model that provides API for navigating the Java element tree.
    The Java element tree defines a Java centric view of a project. It surfaces
    elements like package fragments, compilation units, binary classes, types,
    methods, fields.
  * A Java Document Model providing API for manipulating a structured Java
    source document.
  * Code assist and code select support.
  * An indexed based search infrastructure that is used for searching, code
    assist, type hierarchy computation, and refactoring. The Java search engine
    can accurately find precise matches either in sources or binaries.
  * Evaluation support either in a scrapbook page or a debugger context.
  * Source code formatter

Description: Eclipse Java Compiler Apt IDE
 Eclipse JDT Core is the Java infrastructure of the Eclipse Java IDE.
 It includes:
  * An incremental Java compiler. Implemented as an Eclipse builder, it is based
    on technology evolved from VisualAge for Java compiler. In particular, it
    allows one to run and debug code which still contains unresolved errors.
  * A Java Model that provides API for navigating the Java element tree.
    The Java element tree defines a Java centric view of a project. It surfaces
    elements like package fragments, compilation units, binary classes, types,
    methods, fields.
  * A Java Document Model providing API for manipulating a structured Java
    source document.
  * Code assist and code select support.
  * An indexed based search infrastructure that is used for searching, code
    assist, type hierarchy computation, and refactoring. The Java search engine
    can accurately find precise matches either in sources or binaries.
  * Evaluation support either in a scrapbook page or a debugger context.
  * Source code formatter
 .
 This package contains the org.eclipse.jdt.apt.pluggable.core bundle.

Description: Eclipse AST View Plug-in
 Eclipse JDT UI implements the user interface for the Java IDE. It provides
 several workbench contributions for viewing and manipulating Java code:
  * Package Explorer View - shows the Java element tree as defined
    by a project's build class path
  * Type Hierarchy View - shows the sub- and supertype hierarchies
  * Java Outline View - shows the structure of a Java compilation unit
    or class file
  * Java Browsing Perspecitve - allows navigating the Java model using
    separate views for projects, packages, types and members.
  * Wizards for creating Java elements - Java project, package, class,
    interface
  * Java Editor - syntax coloring, content specific code assist, code
    resolve, method level edit, import assistance, quick fix and quick
    assist
 .
 In addition to these workbench elements the following functions are provided:
  * Refactoring support - Extract Method, Safe Rename and Moving with
    reference updates, Self Encapsulate Field etc.
  * Java searching - find declarations of and/or references to packages,
    types, methods, and fields, scoped to the workspace, a working set,
    or the current selection.
  * Java aware structured compare - determine and present changes to
    individual Java methods. It supports to replace individual Java elements
    with a version of an element from the local history.

Description: Eclipse SWTChart creates different types of charts
 The API allows one to create Line, Bar and Scatter charts easily. Size,
 colors, axes, ranges and all aspects of the charts can be modified via
 code. It is easy to create customized charts. The library already contains
 data compression to show large data sets in a performant way. Charts can be
 created even more easily with the SWTChart extensions. It uses the convention
 over configuration pattern and offers many additional improvements to scale
 axes of different type automatically or to select specific data ranges.

 EscapeVelocity has no facilities for HTML escaping and it is not appropriate
 for producing HTML output that might include portions of untrusted input.

Description: font loading and glyph rasterization library -- documentation
 fcft is a small font loading and glyph rasterization library built on-top of
 FontConfig, FreeType2 and pixman.
 .
 It can load and cache fonts from a fontconfig-formatted name string, e.g.
 Monospace:size=12, optionally with user configured fallback fonts.
 .
 After a font has been loaded, you can rasterize glyphs. When doing so, the
 primary font is first considered. If it does not have the requested glyph, the
 user configured fallback fonts (if any) are considered. If none of the user
 configured fallback fonts has the requested glyph, the FontConfig generated
 list of fallback fonts are checked.
 .
 This package contains the documentation as man pages.

Description: OSGi Resolver implementation by Apache Felix
 Apache Felix is a community effort to implement the OSGi Framework and Service
 platform and other interesting OSGi-related technologies under the Apache
 license. The OSGi specifications originally targeted embedded devices and home
 services gateways, but they are ideally suited for any project interested in
 the principles of modularity, component-orientation, and/or
 service-orientation. OSGi technology combines aspects of these aforementioned
 principles to define a dynamic service deployment framework that is amenable
 to remote management.

Description: FireWall KNock OPerator - documentation
 The FireWall KNock OPerator implements an authorization scheme called
 Single Packet Authorization (SPA), based on Netfilter and libpcap.
 .
 Its main application is to protect services such as OpenSSH with
 an additional layer of security in order to make the exploitation of
 vulnerabilities (both 0-day and unpatched code) much more difficult.
 .
 The authorization server passively listens for authorization packets via
 libpcap, so there is no service listening for network connections on the
 traditional port. Access to a protected service is only granted after a
 valid encrypted and non-replayed packet is detected.
 .
 This package provides the library documentation.

Description: documentation for libfreecontact
 FreeContact is a protein residue contact predictor optimized for speed.
 Its input is a multiple sequence alignment. FreeContact can function as an
 accelerated drop-in for the published contact predictors
 EVfold-mfDCA of DS. Marks (2011) and
 PSICOV of D. Jones (2011).
 .
 FreeContact is accelerated by a combination of vector instructions, multiple
 threads, and faster implementation of key parts.
 Depending on the alignment, 8-fold or higher speedups are possible.
 .
 A sufficiently large alignment is required for meaningful results.
 As a minimum, an alignment with an effective (after-weighting) sequence count
 bigger than the length of the query sequence should be used. Alignments with
 tens of thousands of (effective) sequences are considered good input.
 .
 jackhmmer(1) from the hmmer package, or hhblits(1) from hhsuite
 can be used to generate the alignments, for example.
 .

Description: dependently typed functional programming language; documentation
 Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language: It has inductive
 families, which are like Haskell's GADTs, but they can be indexed by values and
 not just types. It also has parameterised modules, mixfix operators, Unicode
 characters, and an interactive Emacs interface (the type checker can assist in
 the development of your code).
 .
 Agda is also a proof assistant: It is an interactive system for writing and
 checking proofs. Agda is based on intuitionistic type theory, a foundational
 system for constructive mathematics developed by the Swedish logician Per
 Martin-Löf. It has many similarities with other proof assistants based on
 dependent types, such as Coq, Epigram and NuPRL.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.

Description: Android Plugin for Gradle
 The Android build system uses the Android Plugin for Gradle to support building
 Android applications with the Gradle build toolkit. The plugin runs independent
 of Android Studio so the plugin and the Gradle build system can be updated
 independently of Android Studio. You can build your Android applications from
 within Android Studio or from the command line on your machine or on machines
 where Android Studio is not installed (such as continuous integration servers).
 .
 This package does not include gradle-experimental.jar because its dependencies
 are hard to resolve in Debian.
 .
 To build an Android application using the plugin in Debian, install
 `android-debian-helper` and use the init.gradle provided by that package.

Description: lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser
 It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends) as your template
 language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's
 components clearly and succinctly. It automatically synchronizes data from
 your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data
 binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to
 test, AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and
 inversion of control. It also helps with server-side communication, taming
 async callbacks with promises and deferreds; and make client-side navigation
 and deeplinking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a piece of cake.

Description: client-side interpreter for the CoffeeScript language
 CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
 Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons, JavaScript
 has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart. CoffeeScript is an
 attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.
 .
 The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: "It's just JavaScript". The code
 compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no
 interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library
 seamlessly (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable and
 pretty-printed, passes through JavaScript Lint without warnings, will
 work in every JavaScript implementation, and tends to run as fast or
 faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.
 .
 This package contains a concatenated and compressed version of the
 CoffeeScript compiler. To use it in the browser, include the script
 after any inline script tags of type "text/coffeescript" on the page.
 It will compile and evaluate all of the scripts in order.

Description: Logging library for java
 log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of
 output targets.
 .
 It is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application
 binary. The log4j package is designed so that log statements can remain in
 shipped code without incurring a high performance cost.
 .
 One of the distinctive features of log4j is the notion of hierarchical
 loggers. Using loggers it is possible to selectively control which log
 statements are output at arbitrary granularity.
 .
 Log4j can output to: a file, a rolling file, a database with a JDBC driver,
 many output  asynchronously, a JMS Topic, a swing based logging console,
 the NT event log, /dev/null, a SMTP server (using javamail), a socket server,
 syslog, telnet daemon and stdout.
 .
 The format of the output can be defined using one of the various layout
 (or user defined layout) like: simple text, html, date, pattern defined and
 XML.

Description: Apache Log4j - Logging Framework for Java
 Apache Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements
 over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x:
 .
 API Separation: The API for Log4j is separate from the implementation making
 it clear for application developers which classes and methods they can use
 while ensuring forward compatibility.
 .
 Improved Performance: Log4j 2 contains next-generation Asynchronous Loggers
 based on the LMAX Disruptor library. In multi-threaded scenarios Asynchronous
 Loggers have 10 times higher throughput and orders of magnitude lower latency
 than Log4j 1.x.
 .
 Support for multiple APIs: While the Log4j 2 API will provide the best
 performance, Log4j 2 provides support for the SLF4J and Commons Logging APIs.
 .
 Automatic Reloading of Configurations: Log4j 2 can automatically reload its
 configuration upon modification. It will do so without losing log events
 while reconfiguration is taking place.
 .
 Advanced Filtering: Log4j 2 supports filtering based on context
 data, markers, regular expressions, and other components in the Log event.
 Filtering can be specified to apply to all events before being passed to
 Loggers or as they pass through Appenders.
 .
 Plugin Architecture: Log4j uses the plugin pattern to configure components.
 As such, no code is needed to create and configure an Appender, Layout,
 Pattern Converter, and so on. Log4j automatically recognizes plugins
 and uses them when a configuration references them.
 .
 Property Support: Properties can be referenced in a configuration, Log4j will
 directly replace them, or Log4j will pass them to an underlying component that
 will dynamically resolve them. Properties come from values defined in the
 configuration file, system properties, environment variables, the
 ThreadContext Map, and data present in the event.

Description: minimal AMD API implementation for use in optimized browser builds
 Some developers like to use the AMD API to code modular JavaScript,
 but after doing an optimized build, they do not want to include a
 full AMD loader like RequireJS, since they do not need all that
 functionality.
 .
 In the context of Javascript modules, AMD refers to a format
 specification which makes modules  easier to use. See
 http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#amd
 .
 Some use cases, like mobile, are very sensitive to file sizes.
 .
 By including almond in the built file, there is no need for
 RequireJS.  almond is around **1 kilobyte** when minified with
 Closure Compiler and gzipped.

Description: Arbitrary-precision decimal and non-decimal arithmetic for Node.js
 Features:
 .
    - Faster, smaller, and perhaps easier to use than Javascript versions of
      Java's BigDecimal
    - 5 KB minified and gzipped
    - Simple API but full-featured
    - Works with numbers with or without fraction digits in bases from 2 to 36
      inclusive
    - Replicates the toExponential, toFixed, toPrecision and toString methods of
      Javascript's Number type
    - Includes a toFraction and a squareRoot method
    - Stores values in an accessible decimal floating point format
    - No dependencies
    - Comprehensive documentation and test set
 .
 If an even smaller and simpler library is required see big.js. It's half the
 size but only works with decimal numbers and only has half the methods. It
 neither allows NaN or Infinity, or have the configuration options of this
 library.
 .
 This package provides bignumber support to Node.js.

 class to create the passwords themselves (mainly for debugging use) or use
 the check functions to safely check the validity of the keys. The checkTotp
 function also includes a helper to battle timedrift.
 .
 Also includes a static GoogleAuthenticator function class to generate a
 correct url for the QR code, so you can easy scan it with your device.
 Google Authenticator is available as application for iPhone and Android.
 This removes the burden to create such an app from the developers of
 websites by using this set of classes.

Description: extraction of elements from LaTeX documents as graphics
 The purpose of preview is the extraction of selected elements from a
 LaTeX source, like formulas or graphics, into separate pages of a DVI
 file.  A flexible and convenient interface allows it to specify what
 commands and constructs should be extracted.  This works with DVI files
 postprocessed by either Dvips and Ghostscript or dvipng, but it also
 works when using PDFTeX for generating PDF files.
 .
 Currently, preview.sty is used by preview-latex, the WYSIWYG component of
 the AUCTeX editing environment; for generation of previews in LyX; as
 part of the operation of the ps4pdf and pst-pdf LaTeX packages; by the
 tbook XML system and some other tools.

Description: process small angle scattering data (documentation)
 BioXTAS RAW is a GUI based, Python program for reduction and
 analysis of small-angle X-ray solution scattering (SAXS) data.
 The package is designed for biological SAXS data.
 .
 BioXTAS RAW provides an alternative to closed source programs
 such as Primus and Scatter for primary data analysis. Because
 it can calibrate, mask, and integrate images it also provides
 an alternative to synchrotron beamline pipelines that scientists
 can install on their own computers and use both at home and at
 the beamline.
 .
 This is the BioXTAS RAW documentation package.

Description: async task/job queue based on message passing (Documentation)
 Celery is an open source asynchronous task queue/job queue based on
 distributed message passing. It is focused on real-time operation,
 but supports scheduling as well.
 .
 The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on one
 or more worker nodes. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the
 background) or synchronously (wait until ready).
 .
 Celery is written in Python, but the protocol can be implemented
 in any language. It can also operate with other languages using
 webhooks.
 .
 The recommended message broker is RabbitMQ, but limited support for Redis,
 Beanstalk, MongoDB, CouchDB, and databases (using SQLAlchemy or the Django
 ORM) is also available. Celery is easy to integrate with Django, using the
 python-django-celery package.
 .

 Colorzero is a library for working with colors in Python. It is not intended
 to be as comprehensive as colormath, but is intended to be a little easier
 to use, particularly for beginners. The major difference with colorzero is
 that colors are tuples and thus immutable. Standard mathematical operators
 (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) are used to generate new
 colors. Conversions are provided for a wide variety of systems including
 YUV, RGB565, CMYK, CIE Lab, and so on.

Description: Python parser for the CommonMark Markdown spec -- doc
 Pure Python port of `jgm''s CommonMark, a Markdown parser and renderer for the
 CommonMark (http://commonmark.org) specification, using only native modules.
 .
 This provides the CommonMark-py Python package as developed by Bibek Kafle and
 Roland Shoemaker (BKRS). After release 0.5.4, their project moved to `Read the
 Docs' (http://readthedocs.org) and major changes broke compatibility. However
 some Python packages may still depend on their last implementation, hence this
 Debian package which is meant to smooth the transition.
 .
 This is the common documentation package.

Description: next-gen compiler for finite element variational forms (docs)
 The FEniCS Form Compiler FFC provides state-of-the-art automatic and
 efficient evaluation of general multilinear forms (variational
 formulations) for FEniCS. FFC functions as the form evaluation
 system for DOLFIN but can also be used to compile forms for other
 systems.
 .
 FFC works as a compiler for multilinear forms by generating code (C
 or C++) for the evaluation of a multilinear form given in
 mathematical notation. This new approach to form evaluation makes it
 possible to combine generality with efficiency; the form can be given
 in mathematical notation and the generated code is as efficient as
 hand-optimized code.
 .
 This package installs documentation for the next-generation FFC-X library.

Description: Flask extension that provides bcrypt hashing utilities (Documentation)
 Due to the recent increased prevelance of powerful hardware,
 such as modern GPUs, hashes have become increasingly easy to crack.
 A proactive solution to this is to use a hash that was designed to be

 such as MD5 and SHA1, which are optimized for speed, bcrypt is intentionally
 structured to be slow.

Description: manage callbacks in asyncio projects
 Signal is a list of registered asynchronous callbacks.
 .
 The signal's life-cycle has two stages: after creation its content
 could be filled by using standard list operations: `sig.append()` etc.
 .
 After you call `sig.freeze()` the signal is frozen: adding, removing
 and dropping callbacks is forbidden.
 .
 The only available operation is calling the previously registered
 callbacks by using `await sig.send(data)`.

Description: Distributed tracing instrumentation for asyncio application with zipkin
 aiozipkin is a Python module that adds distributed tracing
 capabilities from asyncio applications with zipkin (http://zipkin.io)
 server instrumentation.
 .
 zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data
 needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures.
 It manages both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkin’s
 design is based on the Google Dapper paper.
 .
 Applications are instrumented with  aiozipkin report timing data to
 zipkin. The Zipkin UI also presents a Dependency diagram showing how
 many traced requests went through each application. If you are
 troubleshooting latency problems or errors, you can filter or sort all
 traces based on the application, length of trace, annotation, or
 timestamp.

Description: extension to manage form history
 An extension to View and Manage all form data that has been saved by the
 web browser giving you full control over what is stored, what is cleaned up
 or not, and when to perform a cleanup. This extension even allows you to
 control selectively for which webpages form history data is stored (either
 blacklist or whitelist). Also stores text from editor fields as you type
 for easy recovery in case of disaster.
 .
 This extension enables you to selectively delete privacy sensitive
 information without having to delete the entire history. With the help of
 powerful regular expressions, information can simply and effectively be
 retrieved, edited or deleted. Use it to correct misspelled entries, get rid
 of sensitive data like private banking info or delete passwords that were
 entered into the wrong formfield.
 .
 This plugin also stores text from editor fields as you type, so you never
 have to loose your work when disaster strikes. Recover your lost work after
 session timeouts, network failures, browser crashes, power failures and all
 other things that will destroy the hard work you just put into writing that
 important email, essay or blog post.
 .
 Form History Control can filter data either by keyword, active page, active
 field or cleanup criteria. Powerful advanced search options allows you to
 find information by name, value, timeframe, usage or host. Optional regular
 expressions provide a very effective way to retrieve any information you
 might look for. The advanced search option comes with a list of predefined
 regular expressions which can be altered or extended to fit any need.
 .
 The extension also offers the possibility to export/import form history
 data and configuration settings, allowing you to exchange data between
 multiple browser configurations or import history data into your own
 application of choice.
 .
 Form History Control can also be used to easily autofill textfields in a
 web form using either the most used or the last used formhistory data.
